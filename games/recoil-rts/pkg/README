| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Datasize
========

${PKGSTEM} needs datasize of at least 4-6G to launch, see login.conf(5) and
ksh(1).

Installing Engines
==================

Different engines are built with ${PKGSTEM}. ${PKGSTEM} itself only provides
the building blocks, so in order to run anything, you need to add an engine.
The best known and best supported engines for ${PKGSTEM} are Zero-K and
Beyond All Reason. For example, install Zero-K this way:

	$ pr-downloader zk:stable

And Beyond All Reason:

	$ pr-downloader byar:stable

It will then show up as an engine that can be selected in the ${PKGSTEM} GUI.

Setting up Lobbies
==================

Running ${PKGSTEM} without a lobby set up will allow testing of maps, engines,
and settings. To add a lobby, you need to download it and then launch it with:

	1. use `--menu <menu>' argument to spring, or

Installing Lobbies
------------------

To install Chobby lobby, run the following:

	$ pr-downloader chobby:stable	# latest stable version
		or
	$ pr-downloader chobby:test	# latest test version

Then launch it for example with:

	$ spring --menu 'rapid://chobby:test'

Or set it as the default by adding `DefaultLuaMenu = <menu> <version>' to
~/.config/spring/springsettings.cfg.

Installing Maps
===============

Maps can be installed in one of three ways: via the lobby interface, with
pr-downloader, or by manually downloading the map and placing it in
~/.spring/maps/. Repositories for maps (subject to change) can for example be
found at:

	https://zero-k.info/Maps
	https://www.beyondallreason.info/maps
	https://springrts.com/wiki/Maps

Troubleshooting
===============

If ${PKGSTEM} fails to launch, you can try the flag `-safemode'.
