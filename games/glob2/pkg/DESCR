Globulation 2 is an innovative Real-Time Strategy (RTS) game which
reduces micro-management by automatically assigning tasks to units.

Globulation 2 brings a new type of gameplay to RTS games. The player
chooses the number of units to assign to various tasks, and the units do
their best to satisfy the requests. This allows players to manage more
units and focus on strategy rather than on micro-management. Globulation
2 also features AI, allowing single-player games or any possible
combination of human-computer teams. The game also includes a scripting
language for versatile gameplay or tutorials and an integrated map
editor. You can play Globulation 2 in single player mode, through your
local network, or over the Internet with Ysagoon Online Gaming (or YOG
for short).
