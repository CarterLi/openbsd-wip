LordsAWar! is a free, turn-based strategy game where up to 8 players strive for
control of as many cities as possible. Produce new armies in cities to conquer
nearby cities. Using the income from those cities, make more armies to take more
cities. Send a hero to a temple to get a quest, or maybe search a nearby ruin
instead. Play with others or against the computer.

The goal of this project is to make a game that is similar to Warlords II and is
playable on GNU+Linux, Windows, and Macintosh. This project has a longer history
than most people realize!
