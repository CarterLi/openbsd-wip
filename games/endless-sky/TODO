- Investigate segmentation fault
- Do we need libjpeg-turbo?
  (i.e., check consequences of patch-source_ImageBuffer_cpp)
- Use $PREFIX instead of hardcoded /usr/local/ in Files.cpp?
- Avoid gzipped man page? (man/man6/endless-sky.6.gz)
- Get rid of debugging options in Makefile (CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS)
