Spring BAR:
-----------
- Naming: spring-bar or recoil? (see different names used upstream)
- check about replacing std::shuffle with spring::random_shuffle from rts/System/Cpp11Compat.hpp ?
- currently segfaulting with different port code places and the intel iris driver in the stacktrace
- make hardcoded version in patches smarter
- xsimd_alligned_allocator.hpp: is header sys/malloc.h truly needed?

Old:
----
- address cmake warning that -O2 -pipe will "very likely not sync in online mode"
- fix man page generation; looks for docbook (textproc/docbook) in configure stage, textproc/libxslt, asciidoc
- ONLY_FOR_ARCHS=amd64 really needed?
- add SHARED_LIBS +/- versioning, e.g. libunitsync.so
- Java dependencies, incl MODULES=java really needed?
- does it need Lua dependencies? Uses it at runtime at least. Add MODULES=lang/lua?
- Is -DAI_TYPES="NATIVE" really needed? (taken from FreeBSD port, also seems to be in the beyond-all-reason build options)

- remove debug flags (-O0 -g) when not needed anymore
- rework replacing std::random_shuffle based on FreeBSD example? Or use Cpp11Compat (see above)

- glob(3) workaround for tilde expansion can't expand env variables like wordexp can. Consider more complete implementation of that, and restore use of ${XDG_CONFIG_DIR} ?
- make GetProcessExecutableFile smarter - currently hardcodes /usr/local/bin/spring, but there are other binaries included in the port that need to be accounted for: spring-dedicated and spring-headless. (May need to store argv[0] in Run(), then use it here in rts/System/Platform/Misc.cpp.)
