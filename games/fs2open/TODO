* write/expand pkg/DESCR
* pkg/MESSAGE with instructions
* clean up Makefile
* currently segfaults
* set up wrapper script
* set FS2PATH properly (to ~/.local/share/fs2open ?)
* fix how to deal with the git submodules. currently in post-extract, but that won't fly (see https://github.com/jasperla/openbsd-wip/commit/4d029ca52a7cb1c792db8b501ebfe19b6339b5d3). Will likely need to roll and host own tarball
* strip architecture from binary name (see https://github.com/jasperla/openbsd-wip/commit/4d029ca52a7cb1c792db8b501ebfe19b6339b5d3)
* remove debug flag CFLAGS=-g from Makefile
