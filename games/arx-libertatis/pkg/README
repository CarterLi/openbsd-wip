Arx Libertatis
==============
Arx Libertatis requires the original game files from Arx Fatalis to work
properly.  These can come from an original CD or from GOG.com.

If using the GOG.com version, you must extract the files from
setup_arx_fatalis_2.0.0.7.exe using the innoextract package. The files
will be in a directory named app. You must copy some of the contents of
the app directory to the ~/.local/share/arx/datadir directory

The easiest way to do this is to execute the following:
$ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/arx/datadir
$ cp app/*.pak ~/.local/share/datadir/arx
$ cp -R app/misc ~/.local/share/datadir/arx

NOTE: You need to convert all copied files to lower case for Arx
Libertatis to find them. This does not appear to be an issue with the
files in the misc directory.

You can then delete everything extracted from the exe, such as the tmp
directory.
