In order to play the game, it needs the proprietary assets from
the named "Blessed Edition", (e.g. 3.1.x) (the previous version, called 
"Cursed Edition" (e.g. 2.0.x) is not workable with this package version).

Those assets needs to be placed into the ${LOCALBASE}/share/games/barony folder
or alternatively into a chosen folder but the barony executable needs to be
launched with the -datadir option.

At last an editor is provided (barony-editor).
