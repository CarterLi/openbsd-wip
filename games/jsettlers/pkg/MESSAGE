  java -jar ${PREFIX}/bin/JSettlersServer.jar 8880 10 dbUser dbPass &

  # If MySQL is not installed and running (See "Database Setup"), you
  # will see a warning with the appropriate explanation: 
  #
  #  Warning: failed to initialize database: ....  
  # 
  # The server will function normally except that user accounts cannot 
  # be maintained.

  # Start the robot players 
  java -cp ${PREFIX}/bin/JSettlersServer.jar \
    soc.robot.SOCRobotClient localhost 8880 robot1 passwd &
  java -cp ${PREFIX}/bin/JSettlersServer.jar \
    soc.robot.SOCRobotClient localhost 8880 robot2 passwd &
  java -cp ${PREFIX}/bin/JSettlersServer.jar \
    soc.robot.SOCRobotClient localhost 8880 robot3 passwd &
