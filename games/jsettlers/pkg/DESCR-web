Play an immigrant on the newly populated island of Catan. Build
settlements, roads, and villages by taking commodities from the land
around you. Turn a sheep, lumber, rocks and some grain into a
settlement, bricks and wood into road, or try to complete other
combinations for more advanced buildings and services. Take advantage of
trades with other players, or at local seaports to get commodities you
might lack. The first player to gain 10 points from a combination of
roads, settlements, and special cards wins.

This applet is based on a board game that you can buy from the good
people at Mayfair Games.
