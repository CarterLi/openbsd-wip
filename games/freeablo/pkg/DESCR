freeablo is a modern cross platform reimplementation of the game engine
used in Diablo 1. As it is just an engine, you will need the original
data files to play the game.

Currently, you can run around town, players and NPCs animate, and you
can go down into the first few levels of the dungeon (which is randomly
generated), and a couple of other things.
