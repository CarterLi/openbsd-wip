could not load libXrandr.so.2, Error: File not found
 -> we have currently libXrandr.so.7.1

when running godot4-tools:
godot4-tools(36525) in free(): bogus pointer (double free?) 0x6b73616d00000005

both editor (godot4-tools) and export template (godot4) segfault. With test
case 8-Colors Star Guardians Plus, menu works, but segfault when trying to
start a new game.

This will ultimately need integration with the godot 3 port in ports.
