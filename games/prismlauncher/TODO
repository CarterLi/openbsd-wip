I took some patches from the FreeBSD ports tree, although it needed to be modified.

This bypassed the "Unknown Platform" runtime error.

liblwjgl.so isn't provided by any package on OpenBSD to my knowledge, but liblwjgl64.so *is*

With these patches, this software seems to be hardcoded to look for liblwjgl.so (no 64)

Could not get a game to launch.
