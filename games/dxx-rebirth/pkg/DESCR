Do you like getting disoriented flying through narrow corridors while
getting fired at from 6 degrees of freedom? Enjoy looking at confusing
maps that look like yarn after your cats played with it? Love blowing up
reactors that should red balls at you, only to get lost trying to find
the exit afterwards and getting blown up with the entire mine? If this
sounds fun to you, you have probably played Descent 1 or 2. dxx-rebirth
is the official portable version of the open-sourced engine.
