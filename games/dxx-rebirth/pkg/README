Currently only builds for Descent 1. In order to play Descent 1, put the
the game files in $HOME/.d1x-rebirth folder and change all filenames to
lower case. In the gog.com version, the Windows executable can be
extracted with innoextract (in ports) - the files are in the app folder.
No other folders or subfolders are needed.  Then enter 'd1x-rebirth' to
run the game.
