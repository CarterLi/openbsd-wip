strife-ve is the GPL Source Release of Strife: Veteran Edition. Strife
is considered to be the original FPS-RPG game.

The plot takes place in a world taken over by a religious organization
known as "The Order"; the protagonist, an unnamed mercenary (sometimes
referred to as Strifeguy), becomes a member of the resistance movement
which aims to topple the Order's oppressive rule.

Strife added some role-playing game elements to the classic first-person
shooter formula, such as allowing players to talk to other characters in
the game's world or improve the protagonist's abilities.
