Strife-VE
=========
Strife-VE requires the original game files from The Original Strife:
Veteran Edition to work properly.  This most often comes from the
GOG.com release of the game.

You must extract the files from
setup_the_original_strife_-_veteran_edition_gog-2a_(12083)_(g).exe using
using the innoextract package. The files will be in a directory named
app.  Copy the game data files:

# cp {strife1,voices,SVE}.wad ${PREFIX}/share/strife-ve/

Optionally, you may copy the movies/ and music/ directories to the same
location for intro trailers and enhanced game music.  Copy the example
configuration to enable the music substitutions:

$ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/strife-ve/music
$ cp ${PREFIX}/share/examples/strife-ve/strife-music.cfg \
	~/.local/share/strife-ve/music/
