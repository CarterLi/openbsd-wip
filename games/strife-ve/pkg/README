Strife-VE
=========
Strife-VE requires the original game files from The Original Strife:
Veteran Edition to work properly.  This most often comes from the
GOG.com release of the game.

You must extract the files from
setup_the_original_strife_-_veteran_edition_gog-2a_(12083)_(g).exe using
using the innoextract package. The files will be in a directory named
app. You must keep this directory, though it can be renamed and moved to
a location of your choosing, and you can delete everything else that is
extracted from the exe, such as the tmp directory.

strife-ve should be launched from the app directory for full video and
music support.
