Strife-VE
=========
Strife-VE requires the original game files from The Original Strife:
Veteran Edition to work properly.  This most often comes from the
GOG.com release of the game.

You must extract the files from
setup_the_original_strife_-_veteran_edition_gog-2a_(12083)_(g).exe using
using the innoextract package. The files will be in a directory named
app. You must copy the game data files to the global install directory.

The easiest way to do this is to issue the following commands:
# cp app/strife1.wad ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/strife-ve/
# cp app/voices.wad ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/strife-ve/
# cp app/SVE.wad ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/strife-ve/

Optionally, you may copy the movies/ and music/ directories to the same
location for intro trailers and enhanced game music:
# cp app/movies ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/strife-ve/
# cp app/music ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/strife-ve/

You must then tell strife-ve how to access the enhanced music:
$ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/strife-ve/music
$ cp ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/examples/strife-ve/strife-music.cfg \
	~/.local/share/strife-ve/music/

You may then delete everything else extracted from the exe, such as the
tmp directory.
