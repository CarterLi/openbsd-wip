openage: a volunteer project to create a free engine clone of the Genie
Engine used by Age of Empires, Age of Empires II (HD) and Star Wars:
Galactic Battlegrounds, comparable to projects like OpenMW, OpenRA,
OpenSAGE, OpenTTD and OpenRCT2. At the moment we focus our efforts on
the integration of Age of Empires II, while being primarily aimed at
POSIX platforms such as GNU/Linux.

openage uses the original game assets (such as sounds and graphics), but
(for obvious reasons) doesn't ship them. To play, you require an
original AoE II: TC or AoE II: HD installation (via Wine or
Steam-Linux).

While this package and the game engine are open source, one still needs
to provide the original game assets from Age of Empires II, which is not
open source. You will need to purchase the original game to use this
package.
