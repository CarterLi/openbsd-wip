- nexuiz-glx no workee: have to preload libGL.so.* (-gl_driver), hardcoded to
  libGL.so.1. :/
- no sound in nexuiz-glx
- nexuiz-sdl works fine, so I'm inclined to just disable nexuiz-glx.
- separate -server subpackage?
- install server scripts like FreeBSD port
- test with newer Mesa as soon as I upgrade Xenocara
