- Download isn't working.
- Need to workaround springlobby attempting to download different versions of Spring RTS with games.
- Remove remaining optimization flags -O[0-3]
- LIB_DEPENDS devel/libgit2/libgit2 not needed for games/springlobby ?
- Keep ONLY_FOR_ARCHS=amd64? Most likely this is the only arch that will work
- Need for dependency on graphics/png? - see project build instructions
- need BDEP on graphics/gmic for CImg.h?
