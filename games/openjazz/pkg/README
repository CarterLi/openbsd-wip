OpenJazz
========
OpenJazz requires the original game files from Jazz Jackrabbit to work
properly.  These can come from an original CD or from GOG.com.

If using the GOG.com version, you must extract the files from
setup_jazz_jackrabbit_2.0hf_(16882).exe using the innoextract package.
The files will be in a directory named app. You must keep this
directory, though it can be renamed and moved to a location of your
choosing, and you can delete everything else that is extracted from the
exe, such as the tmp directory.
