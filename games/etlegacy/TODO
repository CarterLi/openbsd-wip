- Figure out the pure server situation, normally the server
has a etl_bin.pk3 with valid ui/cgame libraries for supported
platforms.  If this isn't desireable default to disabling pure server?

- dlopening cgame seems to require a greater than default datasize limit,
  need to run 'ulimit -d 2000000' first on amd64
