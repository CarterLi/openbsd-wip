Netrek is an Internet game for up to 16 players, written almost
entirely in cross-platform open source software. It combines features
of multi-directional shooters and team-based real-time strategy
games. Players attempt to disable or destroy their opponents' ships
in real-time combat, while taking over enemy planets by bombing
them and dropping off armies they pick up on friendly planets. The
goal of the game is to capture all the opposing team's planets.
