the following libraries in WANTLIB look like masked by RUN_DEPENDS: avcodec avformat avutil curl jpeg swresample swscale
LIB_DEPENDS graphics/openjpeg not needed for graphics/DevIL ?
set March to use different args for 32bit build
remove -O3 flag; honor CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS
remove procfs stuff in sys/linux/main.cpp? (works without removing this)
at this point needs to be set to windowed mode (disable r_*fullscreen in Darkmod.cfg)
