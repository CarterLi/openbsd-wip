Supported Mods
==============

The Xash3D engine supports multiple Goldsrc game mods.  Half-life is
the only ported mod so far.

Half-Life
---------

To play Half-Life, you must have a copy of your `valve' directory from
steam.  You must have write access to this directory as well.

Half-Life is available for purchase on Steam, if you do not have it yet.
Utilize games/depotdownloader to get a copy of your Half-Life game files.

It is unknown if Half-Life data from the original CDs works or not, YMMV.

Add a link to your game data as follows:

  $ cd ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/xash3d
  $ doas ln -s ~/valve

The game can be started with the `xash3d' command once the game data is
installed correctly.
