Supported Mods
==============

The Xash3D engine supports multiple Goldsrc game mods.  Half-life is
the only ported mod so far.

Half-Life
---------

To play Half-Life, you must have a copy of your ``valve'' directory
from steam.  You must have write access to this directory as well.

You can copy this directory from your steam cache of another machine,
as of this time there is no way to natively fetch this data.

It is unknown if Half-Life data from the original CDs works or not,
YMMV if you try.

Steam example (path may vary depending on version):

$ scp -r linuxhost:.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Half-Life/valve \
	~/valve

$ cd ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/xash3d
$ doas ln -s ~/valve

You may also copy the valve directory from a Windows host if available.

The game can be started with the ``xash3d'' command once the game data
is installed correctly.
