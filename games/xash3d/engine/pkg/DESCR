A custom Gold Source engine rewritten from scratch.  Xash3D is
compatible with many of the Gold Source games and mods and should be
able to run almost any existing singleplayer Half-Life mod without a
hitch.  The multiplayer part is not yet completed, multiplayer mods
should work just fine, but bear in mind that some features may not work
at all or work not exactly the way they do in Gold Source Engine.
