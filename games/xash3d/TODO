- passed lib-depends-check and port-lib-depends-check
- passed portcheck
- works with clang8

it seems like they have worked hard on making sure the engine is GPL'd
with any questional bits removed.

UPDATE May 5 2018:
going to submit to ports@ to get wider opinion on licensing.

UPDATE Aug 3 2019:
Updated to xash3d engine 0.19.2, hlsdk current master.  set hlsdk version
to match the actual version of the SDK, 2.3.

upstream has set the license back to the Valve SDK license.  It permits
redistribution in source or binary form so long as its distributed for free.
 As of now, it would seem that is a green light to package.
