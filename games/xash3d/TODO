- passed lib-depends-check and port-lib-depends-check
- passed portcheck

does this need special treatment for clang6?

it seems like they have worked hard on making sure the engine is GPL'd
with any questional bits removed, but I am unsure about the hlsdk itself.

It has a file claiming GPLv3 but the actual valve license on valve's
github page is under their own valve license...

It is still free but would not be valid for PERMIT_PACKAGE_CDROM I think,
if the valve license applies.  would appreciate some extra eyes to make
sure the license marker for the hl mod isn't wrong.
