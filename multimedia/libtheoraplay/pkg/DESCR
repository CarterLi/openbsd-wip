TheoraPlay is a simple library to make decoding of Ogg Theora videos
easier.

A tiny example to pull data out of an .ogv file is about 50 lines of C
code, and a complete SDL-based media player is about 300 lines of code.

TheoraPlay is optimized for multicore CPUs, and is designed to be
programmer-friendly. You will need libogg, libvorbis, and libtheora, of
course, but then you just drop a .c file and two headers into your
project and you're ready to hook up video decoding, without worrying
about Ogg pages, Vorbis blocks, or Theora decoder state.

Places TheoraPlay can be found in use: - Shank.  - Crypt of the
Necrodancer.  - 20XX.  - FNA.

What works: - Decoding video to YV12, IYUV, RGB, RGBA formats.  -
Decoding audio to float32 PCM format.  - Decoding on background thread,
for multicore/SMP support.  - Decoding from a file, or abstract i/o
callbacks.  - Linux support.  - Mac OS X support.  - Windows support.  -
Support x86 and PowerPC processors (and probably others).  - Supports 32
and 64 bit builds.  - May compile and run elsewhere with little to no
modification. Success stories and patches are welcome.

What doesn't work: - No custom allocator support yet.  - Various things
scattered in FIXMEs.  - Contributions of other ports are, of course,
welcome.
