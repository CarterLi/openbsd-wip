Audio input
===========

Linux-orientated plugins are enabled in the build but don't seem to work.
Further investigation (or, better, a sndio plugin) needed.

Webcam video input
==================

The direct V4L2 input source has not yet been ported, but video can be
captured using FFmpeg's access to V4L2.

Set permissions/ownership on /dev/video0 so that the user running OBS
has access to it (one option is to "chown $USER /dev/video0"). Then in
OBS you can add a "Media Source". In the source's settings page, untick
"local file", and enter the following:

Input:		/dev/video0
Source format:	video4linux2
