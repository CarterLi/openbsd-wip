Live media input
================

Linux-orientated audio plugins don't seem to work correctly on OpenBSD,
and the direct V4L2 input source plugin has not yet been ported, but
both video and audio can be captured using FFmpeg.

Video
-----
Set permissions/ownership on /dev/video0 so that the user running OBS
has access to it (one option is to "chown $USER /dev/video0"). Then in
OBS you can add a "Media Source". In the source's settings page, untick
"local file", and enter the following:

Input:		/dev/video0
Source format:	video4linux2

Audio
-----
Add another "Media Source". In the source's settings page, untick
"local file", and enter the following:

Input:		snd/0   (or other sndio port name as appropriate)
Source format:	sndio
