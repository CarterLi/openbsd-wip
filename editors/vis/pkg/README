Name of executable
==================

Although the project is called "vis" and the binary is supposed to be called
"vis", on OpenBSD the binary is called "vise" due to the conflict with vis(1)
from base.

Note, as upstream is considering other names for the project, the name of
executable may change in future.

Using vis with tmux
===================

Both tmux and libtermkey, a library used for getting keyboard input in vis, wait
after an escape is input to determine if it is part of a function or meta key
sequences.  This leads to false positives in meta key sequences detection in
vis.  To work around this bug one may reduce such delay in tmux to a value below
the default 50 ms value in libtermkey by setting "escape-time" setting in tmux
configuration:

	set-option escape-time 40
