Why is the Escape Key Not Working Right?
========================================

If you use neovim under tmux, you are being bitten by a libtermkey bug. Read
the libtermkey package README for a workaround.

Migrating from Vim to Neovim
============================

Note that in neovim some paths are different from traditional vim. The config
dir is ~/.config/nvim, and the main config file is ~/.config/nvim/init.vim. You
can symlink your existing traditional vim config and directory to the new
paths, and this will work.

The first time you invoke nvim, run ':CheckHealth' to see what else you might
need to do to migrate.

Xfce Terminal, Tiling WMs and Neovim
====================================

If you experience neovim crashes when spawning new windows under a tiling
window manager, and you are running neovim under an Xfce terminal, switching to
another terminal emulator may work around the crashes:
