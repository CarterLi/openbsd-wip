Arb is a C library for rigorous real and complex arithmetic with
arbitrary precision. Arb tracks numerical errors automatically using
ball arithmetic, a form of interval arithmetic based on a
midpoint-radius representation. On top of this, Arb provides a wide
range of mathematical functionality, including polynomials, power
series, matrices, integration, root-finding, and many transcendental
functions. Arb is designed with efficiency as a primary goal, and is
usually competitive with or faster than other arbitrary-precision
packages. The code is thread-safe, portable, and extensively tested.
