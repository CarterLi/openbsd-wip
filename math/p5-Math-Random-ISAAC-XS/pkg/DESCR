The ISAAC algorithm is designed to take some seed information and produce
seemingly random results as output.

This module implements the same interface as Math::Random::ISAAC and can be
used as a drop-in replacement. This is the recommended implementation of the
module, based on Bob Jenkins' reference implementation in C.
