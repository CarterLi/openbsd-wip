FaCiLe is a constraint programming library on integer and integer
set finite domains written in OCaml. It offers all usual facilities
to create and manipulate finite domain variables, arithmetic
expressions and constraints (possibly non-linear), built-in global
constraints (difference, cardinality, sorting etc.) and search and
optimization goals. FaCiLe allows as well to build easily user-defined
constraints and goals (including recursive ones), making pervasive
use of OCaml higher-order functionals to provide a simple and
flexible interface for the user.
