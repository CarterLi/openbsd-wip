Graphviz is open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a
way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and
networks.

The goal of graphviz has been twofold:

    to find efficient algorithms for making very readable
    drawings of graphs up to several hundreds of nodes,
    approaching the quality of manual layouts (made
    with CAD tools).  The algorithms should scale even
    further, as layout of large graphs can also offer
    a gestalt view of complex systems.

    to create convenient graph drawing systems and web
    services. This means defining useful interfaces and
    features to support applications.
