Cliquer is a set of C routines for finding cliques in an arbitrary weighted
graph. The main features of Cliquer include:

- support for both weighted and unweighted graphs (faster routines for
  unweighted graphs)
- search for maximum cliques / maximum-weight cliques
- search for cliques with size / weight within a given range
- restrict the search to maximal cliques
- store cliques in memory
- call a user-defined function for every clique found
- Cliquer is re-entrant, so you can use the clique-searching functions
  from within the callback function
