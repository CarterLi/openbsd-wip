long overdue update prompted by email from Marty Toews who will
test the updated version.

by having it depend on texlive (tested 2011) the manuals are converted
to dvi, pdf. Else the --configure option --enable-prebuilt-html can
be used for forcing HTML help output. And the build takes too long
and will need to be patched in a gazillion places because install
wants to install pdf, dvi files
