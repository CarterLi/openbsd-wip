long overdue update prompted by email from Marty Toews who will
test the updated version.

by having it depend on texlive (tested 2011) the manuals are converted
to dvi, pdf.

SEPARATE_BUILD=Yes, configure checks if build_dir == src_dir

revision-0:
1) added textproc/icu4c to LIB_DEPENDS and corresponding
change to WANTLIB
2) did pthread related fixes as done in textproc/raptor
3) for some reason, SHARED_LIBS is giving me problems i.e
the version 213.1 vs 30.0. Please ignore for now, while we
actually try to fix the port. When done, we will revisit this
issue.
