- Cleaned up the build, checked that the patches for qhull 2010
are already included in the CMakeLists.txt in ${WRKBUILD} for qhull 2011

- make plist, port-lib-depends-check & lib-depends-check are all
happy.

- qhull 2011 C interface is accessed through lib/libqhullstatic.a + the .so
- qhull 2011 C++ interface accessed through lib/libqhullcpp.a
