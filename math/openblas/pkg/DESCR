OpenBLAS is an open source BLAS library forked from the GotoBLAS2-1.13
BSD version. BLAS stands for Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms. BLAS
provides standard interfaces for linear algebra, including BLAS1
(vector-vector operations), BLAS2 (matrix-vector operations), and BLAS3
(matrix-matrix operations). In general, BLAS is the computational kernel
("the bottom of the food chain") in linear algebra or scientific
applications. Thus, if BLAS implementation is highly optimized, the
whole application can get substantial benefit.
