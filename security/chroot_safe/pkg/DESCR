chroot_safe is a tool to chroot any dynamically linked application
in a safe and sane manner. It is designed to replace chroot and
su nobody -c while at the same time adressing some of the major
shortcomings of of these tools.
It doesn't require that all libraries used by the binary must be
within the chroot jail.
chroot_safe do runtime linking instrument the application to perform 
a full chroot and drop all root privileges just after dynamic linking 
has completed but before the application as such is started.
