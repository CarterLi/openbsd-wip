strongSwan is reasonably portable open source VPN software supporting both
IKEv1 and IKEv2. It has wide support for authentication types including
IKEv1 XAUTH (username and password) and multiple IKEv2 EAP mechanisms on
both server and client side.

The port currently provides only the "kernel-ipsec" plugin. This operates
in userland via tun(4) devices and strongSwan's own IPsec implementation
rather than using kernel IPsec, and is not recommended for production use
on security gateways.

To use this plugin, kernel ESP handling must be disabled:

# sysctl net.inet.esp.enable=0
# sysctl net.inet.esp.udpencap=0
