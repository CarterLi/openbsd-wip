This tool transparently hijacks HTTP traffic on a network, watches for
HTTPS links and redirects, then maps those links into either look-alike
HTTP links or homograph-similar HTTPS links. It also supports modes for
supplying a favicon which looks like a lock icon, selective logging, and
session denial.
