Johnny is a cross-platform Open Source GUI frontend for the popular password
cracker John the Ripper. As well as automating and simplifying the process,
it adds extra desktop/GUI functionality, such as improved hash and password
workflow, multiple attacks and session management, easy definition of complex
attack rules, visual feedback and statistics.

The application uses John The Ripper for the actual work - both the official
core (proper) version and the community-enhanced (jumbo) version are supported,
the latter exposing more functionality (extra cracking modes and hash types).
