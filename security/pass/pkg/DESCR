Password management should be simple and follow Unix philosophy. With pass,
each password lives inside of a gpg encrypted file whose filename is the
title of the website or resource that requires the password. These encrypted
files may be organized into meaningful folder hierarchies, copied from
computer to computer, and, in general, manipulated using standard command
line file management utilities.
