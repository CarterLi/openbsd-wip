This library provides well-tested Python bindings for libsecp256k1,
the heavily optimized C library used by Bitcoin Core for operations
on the elliptic curve secp256k1.  Features:

 * Fastest available implementation (more than 10x faster than
   OpenSSL)
 * Clean, easy to use API
 * Frequent updates from the development version of libsecp256k1
 * Linux, macOS, and Windows all have binary packages for multiple
   architectures
 * Linux & macOS use GMP for faster computation
 * Deterministic signatures as specified by RFC 6979
 * Non-malleable signatures (lower-S form) by default
 * Secure, non-malleable ECDH implementation
