Minimalist is a MINImalist MAiling LIST manager. It is fast, extremely easy
to setup and support. It is written in Perl and tested on OpenBSD/OpenSMTPd.
However there are no causes not to use Minimalist on any other Unix system,
because it doesn't use any system-dependent features.

Minimalist has these features:

 . subscribe/unsubscribe users by request

 . information about list; users, subscribed to list; lists, to which user
    subscribed
 . per-user options:
    * read-only (for open lists)
    * write allow (for read-only lists))
    * maximum message size
 . susped/resume subscription
 . archiving lists (internal and external), with maximum size of archived
    message
 . multilanguage support
 . process MIME-encoded messages
    * including support for local charset (for reports and footer)
 . hook for bounce processing (using VERP - Variable Envelope Return-Path)
 . external delivery of processed message
