- Flipping from autotools to meson changed the PLIST:
  $ diff mail/mu/pkg/PLIST openbsd-wip/mail/mu/pkg/PLIST
  36d35
  < share/emacs/site-lisp/mu4e/mu4e-config.elc

- Once the meson switch is complete, update to 1.10.3

Notes:
    Build with -Dreadline=disabled, because >= 8.0 is required and the
    issues highlighted in <87sgmuazg3.fsf@ritchie.wxcvbn.org> are not
    yet sorted out.
