Autotest is a framework for fully automated testing. It is designed
primarily to test the Linux kernel, though it is useful for many other
functions such as qualifying new hardware. It's an open-source project
under the GPL and is used and developed by a number of organizations,
including Google, IBM, Red Hat, and many others.
