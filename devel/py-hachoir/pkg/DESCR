Hachoir is a Python library to view and edit a binary stream field
by field. In other words, Hachoir allows you to "browse" any binary
stream just like you browse directories and files. A file is splitted
in a tree of fields, where the smallest field is just one bit.
Examples of fields types: integers, strings, bits, padding types,
floats, etc. Hachoir is the French word for a meat grinder (meat
mincer), which is used by butchers to divide meat into long tubes;
Hachoir is used by computer butchers to divide binary files into
fields.
