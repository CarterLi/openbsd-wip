The upstream project has not had a release in more than 4 years,
instead they offer nightly builds for popular OSes.  I plan to
keep continuous integraion going via openbsd-wip, but not sent
to ports@ until needed for a reported issue, or until the project
issues a release.

Source tarballs are created by a git-svn mirror hosted at github.
