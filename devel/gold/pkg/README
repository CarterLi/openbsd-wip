gold
====
gold is an ELF-only linker developed by Google.

It can be easily used by clang by passing the flag
-fuse-ld=gold
on the command line during the linker step.

Caveats:
* gold can create shared libs (libx.so.X.Y) and regular pie executables.
  gold cannot yet create any other kind of executable. Trying to, for
  example, pass -static -pie on the command line during the linker step
  will end with an internal linker error.
