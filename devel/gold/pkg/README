gold
====
gold is an ELF-only linker developed by Google.

It can be easily used by clang by passing the flag
-fuse-ld=gold
on the command line during the linker step.

The easiest way to do this is to add "-fuse-ld=gold" to your LDFLAGS.

Caveats:
* gold can create shared libs (libx.so.X.Y), regular (aka -shared -pie),
  and -static -pie executables. gold cannot yet create -nopie
  executables. Trying to do so will end with an internal linker error.
