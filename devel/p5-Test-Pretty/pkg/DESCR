Test::Pretty is a prettifier for Test::More.
 
When you are writing a test case such as following:
 
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use utf8;
    use Test::More;
 
    subtest 'MessageFilter' => sub {
        my $filter = MessageFilter->new('foo');
 
        subtest 'should detect message with NG word' => sub {
            ok($filter->detect('hello from foo'));
        };
        subtest 'should not detect message without NG word' => sub {
            ok(!$filter->detect('hello world!'));
        };
    };
 
    done_testing;
 
This code outputs following result:

No, it's not readable. Test::Pretty makes this result to pretty.
 
You can enable Test::Pretty by
 
    use Test::Pretty;
 
Or just add following option to perl interpreter.
     
    -MTest::Pretty
 
After this, you can get a following pretty output.

And this module outputs TAP when $ENV{HARNESS_ACTIVE} is true or under the win32.
