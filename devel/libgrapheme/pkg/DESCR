libgrapheme is an extremely simple C99 library providing utilities for properly
handling Unicode strings made up of user-perceived characters ('grapheme
clusters') according to the Unicode standard. While providing convenience
functions to operate on UTF-8-encoded strings, you can also use libgrapheme for
any other encoding as well.
