This is a library for calling C function and manipulating C types from Lua. It
is designed to be interface compatible with the FFI library in LuaJIT (see
http://luajit.org/ext_ffi.html). It can parse C function declarations and
struct definitions that have been directly copied out of C header files and
into lua source as a string.
