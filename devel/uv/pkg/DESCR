Rust. Designed as a drop-in replacement for pip and pip-tools.

- Drop-in replacement for common pip, pip-tools, and virtualenv
  commands.

- Disk-space efficient, with a global cache for dependency
  deduplication.
- Tested at-scale against the top 10,000 PyPI packages.
- Advanced features such as dependency version overrides and alternative
  resolution strategies.
- Best-in-class error messages with a conflict-tracking resolver.
- Support for a wide range of advanced pip features, including editable
  installs, Git dependencies, direct URL dependencies, local
  dependencies, constraints, source distributions, HTML and JSON
  indexes, and more.
