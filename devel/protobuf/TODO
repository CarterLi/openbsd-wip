The WIP port has been submitted to ports@:
https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-ports&m=152960330613162&w=2

The build on macppc is broken due to compiler segfaults.
Optimization levels -O1 and -O0 don't help.

A bulk build by jca@ on sparc64 is in progress.

Regression tests seg:
https://github.com/google/protobuf/issues/2452
This issue is probably resolved, but there are other segfaults.
Leaving this here just in case.

Dependent ports in-tree are tested.

devel/protobuf-c needs to be updated to 1.3.0 (first version supporting proto3)

On amd64 audio/mumble and games/poker need to be fixed.
