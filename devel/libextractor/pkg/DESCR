GNU libextractor is a library used to extract meta data from files
of arbitrary type. It is designed to use helper-libraries to perform
the actual extraction, and to be trivially extendable by linking
against external extractors for additional file types.

The goal is to provide developers of file-sharing networks, browsers
or WWW-indexing bots with a universal library to obtain simple
keywords and meta data to match against queries and to show to users
instead of only relying on filenames. libextractor contains a shell
command extract that, similar to the well-known file command, can
extract meta data from a file an print the results to stdout.
