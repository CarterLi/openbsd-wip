When you need to create a subroutine that returns different values in
different contexts (list, scalar, or void), you can write code that is
more readable. In its simplest usage, this module makes code more
readable by providing three subroutines "LIST()", "SCALAR()", "VOID()"
that are true only when the current subroutine is called in the
corresponding context. Those three subroutines can also be used in
another way: as labels on a series of contextual return blocks
(collectively known as a contextual return sequence). When a context
sequence is returned, it automatically selects the appropriate
contextual return block for the calling context.
