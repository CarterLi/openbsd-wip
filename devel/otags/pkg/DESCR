Otags can be used to build TAGS tables for emacs and vi, like
etags does, but for OCaml code source files. It is based on
the camlp4 parsers, which makes it more accurate than versions
based on regexps: otags finds references to constructors of
sum types, fields of records, etc. The downside of the camlp4
approach is that you can only tag syntactically correct files
and that otags only accepts what camlp4 thinks is correct
(which is sometimes different from ocamlc).
