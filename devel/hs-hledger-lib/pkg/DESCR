This is a reusable library containing hledger's core functionality.

hledger is a cross-platform program for tracking money, time, or any other
commodity, using double-entry accounting and a simple, editable file format. It
is inspired by and largely compatible with ledger(1). hledger provides
command-line, curses and web interfaces, and aims to be a reliable, practical
tool for daily use.
