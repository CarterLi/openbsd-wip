Ruff is an extremely fast Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust.

Ruff aims to be orders of magnitude faster than alternative tools while
integrating more functionality behind a single, common interface.

Ruff can be used to replace Flake8 (plus dozens of plugins), Black, isort,
pydocstyle, pyupgrade, autoflake, and more, all while executing tens or hundreds
of times faster than any individual tool.

Features:
- 10-100x faster than existing linters (like Flake8) and formatters (like Black)
- pyproject.toml support
- Python 3.13 compatibility
- Drop-in parity with Flake8, isort, and Black
- Built-in caching, to avoid re-analyzing unchanged files
- Fix support, for automatic error correction (e.g., automatically remove unused
  imports)
- Over 800 built-in rules, with native re-implementations of popular Flake8
  plugins, like flake8-bugbear
- First-party editor integrations
- Monorepo-friendly, with hierarchical and cascading configuration
