Ruff is an extremely fast Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust.

Ruff aims to be orders of magnitude faster than alternative tools while
integrating more functionality behind a single, common interface.

Ruff can be used to replace Flake8 (plus dozens of plugins), Black, isort,
pydocstyle, pyupgrade, autoflake, and more, all while executing tens or
hundreds of times faster than any individual tool.

Features:
  - 10-100x faster than existing linters (like Flake8) and formatters (like
    Black)
  - pyproject.toml support
  - Python 3.12 compatibility
  - Built-in caching, to avoid re-analyzing unchanged files
  - Fix support, for automatic error correction (e.g., automatically remove
    unused imports)
  - Over 700 built-in rules, with native re-implementations of popular
    Flake8 plugins, like flake8-bugbear
  - First-party editor integrations
  - Monorepo-friendly configuration via hierarchical and cascading
    configuration
