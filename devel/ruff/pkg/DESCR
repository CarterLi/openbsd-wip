ruff is an extremely fast Python linter, written in Rust.

Ruff aims to be orders of magnitude faster than alternative tools while
integrating more functionality behind a single, common interface.

Ruff can be used to replace Flake8 (plus dozens of plugins), isort,
pydocstyle, yesqa, eradicate, pyupgrade, and autoflake, all while
executing tens or hundreds of times faster than any individual tool.

Features:
  - 10-100x faster than existing linters
  - pyproject.toml support
  - Python 3.12 compatibility
  - Built-in caching, to avoid re-analyzing unchanged files
  - Autofix support, for automatic error correction (e.g., automatically
    remove unused imports)
  - Over 700 built-in rules
  - Near-parity with the built-in Flake8 rule set
  - Native re-implementations of dozens Flake8 plugins, like
    flake8-bugbear
  - First-party editor integrations
  - Monorepo-friendly configuration via hierarchical and cascading
    settings
