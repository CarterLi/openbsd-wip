Distributed version control system based on a theory of patches while
still being fast and scalable. It features

* commutation - changes can be applied in any order without changing
  the result or version identifier
* merge correctness - the order between lines is always preserved
* first class conflicts - conflicts happen between two changes and are
  resolved by one change. Due to commutation, once solved, they never
  come back.
* partial clones.
