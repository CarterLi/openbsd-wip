fix devel/ocaml-pcre to build on sparc64

* use new PROPERTIES instead of MODOCAML_NATIVE. This depends on the properties
  being added to arch-defines.mk (See arch-defines.mk.diff) !!!
  Use commit 42f55c5f7925da883531f8932f42fca7505e2549 until then.

* setting WRKSRC=${WRKDIST}/lib in all cases now and use ${WRKDIST} for manual
installs.
* as always: change to "new style" assignments (FOO = BAR instead of FOO= BAR)
