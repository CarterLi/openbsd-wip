Pyinotify is a Python module for monitoring filesystem changes.
Pyinotify relies on inotify, an event-driven notifier; its notifications
are exported from kernel space to user space through three system calls.
Pyinotify binds these system calls and provides an implemenation on top
of them offering a generic and abstract way to manipulate those
functionalities.
