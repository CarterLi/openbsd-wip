structlog is the production-ready logging solution for Python:

Simple: Everything is about functions that take and return dictionaries
- all hidden behind familiar APIs.

Powerful: Functions and dictionaries aren't just simple but also
powerful. structlog leaves you in control.

Fast: structlog is not hamstrung by designs of yore. Its flexibility
comes not at the price of performance.

Thanks to its flexible design, you choose whether you want structlog to
take care of the output of your log entries or whether you prefer to
forward them to an existing logging system like the standard library's
logging module.
