The Firm library implements the Firm intermediate representation (ir).

libFirm contains algorithms for construction of the SSA form directly
from the attributed syntax tree. A set of analyses and optimisation
phases is provided. This version includes a complete backend for the
IA32 architecture, as well as some unfinished backends for SPARC and
ARM.
