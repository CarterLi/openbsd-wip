Bugs Everywhere is a distributed bugtracker, designed to complement
distributed revision control systems. By using distributed revision
control as a backend for bug state, several convenient features are
gained:

  * Bugs and code that live on branches are tracked together when
    a branch is merged, both the code changes and bug changes that
    the branch contains are merged alongside each other. We no
    longer have to be confused about whether a fix that is applied
    to the development branch but not yet present in the production
    branch means that our bug is fixed.

  * Users can fully modify bug state while offline, unlike with
    many centralized bugtrackers.

  * When a user checks out your source code, she gets the current
    bug state for free.

  * We can still provide access to a friendly web interface for
    users in this model, a web interface becomes just another client
    that merges with the main repository.
