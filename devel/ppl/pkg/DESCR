The Parma Polyhedra Library is a C++ library for (not necessarily
closed) convex polyhedra and other numerical abstractions.

To be more precise, the Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) can handle:

  + all the convex polyhedra that can be defined as the intersection
    of a finite number of (open or closed) hyperspaces, each described
    by an equality or a (strict or non-strict) inequality with
    rational coefficients;

  + convex polyhedra defined by systems of bounded differences with
    a wide choice of integer, rational or floating point coefficients;

  + all grids (or, equivalently, lattices); a grid is defined by a
    set of congruence relations with rational coefficients and
    consists of the set of all points that satisfy these relations;

  + finite powersets of the above;

  + linear programming problems, solved with an implementation of
    the primal simplex algorithm using exact arithmetic.
