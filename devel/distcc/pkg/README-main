distcc
=======
To spawn compilation jobs on remote hosts, a minimal configuration
such as the following can be used as `~/.distcc/hosts`:

    localhost 192.168.178.13

Then set `$CC` to `distcc` to distribute compilation jobs across the
configured nodes.

distccd
=======
In order to allow incoming connections to a "worker", one has to
modify `distccd_flags` to reflect the address/subnet of originating
connections.
