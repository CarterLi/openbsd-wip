distcc
=======
To spawn compilation jobs on remote hosts, a minimal configuration
such as the following can be used as `~/.distcc/hosts`:

    localhost 192.168.178.13

or `/etc/distcc/hosts` for a system-wide configuration.

Then set `$CC` to `distcc` to distribute compilation jobs across the
configured nodes.

#ifdef notyet
USE_DISTCC
==========
To allow building ports with distcc, set `USE_DISTCC=Yes` either in the
environment or in `/etc/mk.conf`. When using `USE_DISTCC` the the `DISTCC_DIR`
is set to ${WRKOBJDIR}/.distcc.

Note that it's currently not (yet) possible to enable both `USE_DISTCC` and
`USE_CCACHE`. Also pumping mode is not setup/enabled at this moment.

To monitor a build be sure to point DISTCC_DIR to the correct directory.
