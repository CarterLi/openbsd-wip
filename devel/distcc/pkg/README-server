distccd
=======
distcc can run over TCP or SSH. For TCP connections the `distccd`
daemon has to be running on the remote hosts. Jobs will run by default
as the unprivileged `_distcc` user. In order to allow incoming
connections to a "worker", one has to modify `distccd_flags` to
reflect the address/subnet of originating connections.

For SSH connections prefix hosts with `@` in the host
specification. distcc will run the jobs as the user invoking distcc.
