git-gpg provides git-based, GPG-encrypted distributed version control.
Specifically, it is useful for collaborating with other trusted endpoints
through semi-trusted or untrusted middle-points (e.g., through a VPS on the
cloud).

At a high level, it encrypts the data objects in your .git directory, and then
uploads those files to a remote directory using rsync-over-ssh. Simple.
