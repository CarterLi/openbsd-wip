A security oriented, feedback-driven, evolutionary, easy-to-use fuzzer with
interesting analysis options.

It's multi-process and multi-threaded: there's no need to run multiple copies
of your fuzzer, as honggfuzz can unlock potential of all your available CPU
cores with a single running instance. The file corpus is automatically shared
and improved between all fuzzed processes.
