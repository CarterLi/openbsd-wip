This module is an extremely light-weight subset of Moose optimised for
rapid startup and "pay only for what you use".

It also avoids depending on any XS modules to allow simple deployments.
The name Moo is based on the idea that it provides almost -- but not
quite -- two thirds of Moose.

Unlike Mouse this module does not aim at full compatibility with Moose's
surface syntax, preferring instead of provide full interoperability via
the metaclass inflation capabilities described in "MOO AND MOOSE".
