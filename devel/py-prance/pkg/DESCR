Prance provides parsers for Swagger/OpenAPI 2.0 and 3.0 API
specifications in Python. It uses openapi_spec_validator,
swagger_spec_validator or flex to validate specifications, but
additionally resolves JSON references in accordance with the OpenAPI
spec.

Mostly the latter involves handling non-URI references; OpenAPI is fine
with providing relative file paths, whereas JSON references require URIs
at this point in time.
