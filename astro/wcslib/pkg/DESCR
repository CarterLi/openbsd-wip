WCSLIB is a C library, supplied with a full set of Fortran wrappers,
that implements the "World Coordinate System" (WCS) standard in
FITS (Flexible Image Transport System). It also includes a PGPLOT-based
routine, PGSBOX, for drawing general curvilinear coordinate graticules
and a number of utility programs.

The FITS data format is widely used within the international
astronomical community, from the radio to gamma-ray regimes, for
data interchange and archive, and also increasingly as an online
format. It is described in "Definition of The Flexible Image Transport
System (FITS)", FITS Standard, Version 3.0, 2008 July 10 available
