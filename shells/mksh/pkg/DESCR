mksh is a direct descendant from the OpenBSD /bin/ksh and contains most of its
bug fixes and enhancements except the "GNU bash-like $PS1", "POSIX character
class support in globbing" changes, the incompatible "ulimit can handle multiple
limits in one invocation" and several minor difference.

The set -o emacs-usemeta command is no longer needed because the emacs editing
mode has been changed for Unicode/UTF-8 mode, which adds a new set -o utf8-mode
flag. The set -o sh command has been completely removed, set -o posix merely
turns off brace expansion as side effect. There limit on array sizes is relaxed.
Many bugs and security holes have been closed in mksh and are still in oksh and
OpenBSD ksh. The user interface has much less bugs and surprises; emacs editing
mode is enabled by default. In contrast to oksh, set -o arc4random can be used
to control which generator for $RANDOM is used.
