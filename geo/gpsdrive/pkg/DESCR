GpsDrive is a car (bike, ship, plane) navigation system. GpsDrive
displays your position provided from your GPS receiver on a zoomable
map. The maps are autoselected for best resolution depending of
your position and can be downloaded from the Internet. Speech output
is supported if the "festival" software is running. All GPS receivers
supported by gpsd should be usable.
