OSMLR is a specification for identifying parts of a road network based
on OpenLR. The aim is to identify road network parts useful for traffic
segmentation without requiring a particular version of any data source.

The specification is written in Google Protocol Buffers syntax, and there
are many comments within the files to describe the function and intent of
the various parts.
