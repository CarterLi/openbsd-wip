Valhalla is an open source routing engine and accompanying libraries for use
with Open Street Map data. This library, Loki, can be used to associate
location in formation to an underlying graph tile object for use in creating
input to the routing engine. In keeping with the Norse mythological theme,
the name Loki was chosen as a play on the word locate. Since the library
deals mostly with correlating some input (minimally a lat,lon) to an object
within a graph tile, this seemed like a fitting name!
