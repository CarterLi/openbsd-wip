Valhalla is an open source routing engine and accompanying libraries for use
with Open Street Map data. This library/service, Meili, provides a set of
algorithms and datastructures for map matching. It matches a sequence of
locations (usually noisy e.g. GPS trajectory) to the underlying road
network. In keeping with the Norse mythological theme, the name Meili,
Thor's brother, was chosen. Since map matching is closely related to routing
and since Thor is the Valhalla routing library, meili seemed most
appropriate.
