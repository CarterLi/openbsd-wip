Valhalla is an open source routing engine and accompanying libraries for use
with OpenStreetMap data. This library, Odin, serves as a directions engine
for annotating a path as input from the routing engine for use in
navigation. In keeping with the Norse mythological theme, the name Odin was
chosen as he has often been noted as being very wise. Since the library
deals mostly with providing, hopefully wise, guidance along a path to be
used for navigation, this seemed like a fitting name! We've also managed to
create a backronym out of Odin which stands for: Open Directions and
Improved Narrative.
