Valhalla is an open source routing engine and accompanying libraries for
use with Open Street Map data. This library, Midgard, serves as a set of
geographic/metric data structures and algorithms for use in essentially all
other projects under the valhalla organization. In keeping with the Norse
mythological theme, the name Midgard was chosen as it is represents the
world as humans know it. Since the library deals mostly with the maths of
our favorite spheroid, this seemed like a fitting name!
