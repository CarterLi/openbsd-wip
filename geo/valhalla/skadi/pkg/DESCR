Valhalla is an open source routing engine and accompanying libraries for
use with Open Street Map data. This library, Skadi, can be used to access
digital elevation model data which is useful in computing steepness of edges
in the route graph or generating an elevation profile along a computed
route. In keeping with the Norse mythological theme, the jotunn/goddess
Skadi was chosen as she is associated, among other things, with the
mountains. Since the library deals mostly with extracting elevation data
from various datasets, this seemed like a fitting name!
