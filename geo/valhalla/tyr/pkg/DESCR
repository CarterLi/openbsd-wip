Valhalla is an open source routing engine and accompanying libraries for use
with Open Street Map data. This library, Tyr, is a service layer taking
locations and options as input and returning a route and maneuvers as output
essentially linking together all other projects under the valhalla
organization. In keeping with the Norse mythological theme, the name Tyr was
chosen as backcronym standing for: Take Your Route. Since the library deals
mostly with providing routes based on http requests, this seemed like a
fitting name!
