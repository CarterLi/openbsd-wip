Valhalla is an open source routing engine and accompanying libraries for use
with Open Street Map data. This library, Mjolnir, serves as a set of
applications suited to creating tiled routing data for use in the routing
and searching projects under the valhalla organization. In keeping with the
Norse mythological theme, the name Mjolnir was chosen as it represents a
weapon of mass destruction. This seemed fitting since the main application
deals mostly with pounding planet sized OSM data into tiny routable tile
fragments.
