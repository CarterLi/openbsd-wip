Valhalla is an open source routing engine and accompanying libraries for use
with Open Street Map data. This library, Sif, provides dynamic, extensible
costing for edges and transitions between edges (turn costs). Its primary
use is in the routing engine when forming the best path between locations.
In keeping with the Norse mythological theme, the name Sif was chosen since
Sif is a companion to Thor.
