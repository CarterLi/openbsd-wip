Valhalla is an open source routing engine and accompanying libraries for
use with OpenStreetMap data. This library, Thor, serves as a routing engine
backed by tiled open source routing data. Thor is a companion to Sif which
it relies heavily on to determine the appropriate graph traversal. The
resulting path can be used as input for creating guidance/narrative. The
name Thor was chosen as an acronym standing for Tiled Hierarchical Open
Routing.
