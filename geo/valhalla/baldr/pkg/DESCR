Valhalla is an open source routing engine and accompanying libraries for
use with Open Street Map data. This library, Baldr, serves as a set of
routing-specific data structures distilled into a library for use within
other projects under the valhalla organization. In keeping with the Norse
mythological theme, the name Baldr was chosen as a backronym standing for:
Base ALgorithms and Data Resource, since the library deals mostly with
accessing routing data and algorithms related to routing subproblems.
