Unconditionally uses bundled PCRE library, maildrop and who knows what else.

Doesn't like either our YACC or GNU Bison - needs looking if we can avoid GNU shit.

Usual -lpthread problems (currently fixed by configure script patching).

Following warnings occur due to backslashes embedded in XML:

	sql_code_ws.c:20073:1: warning: unknown escape sequence '\.'
	sql_code_ws.c:20073:1: warning: unknown escape sequence '\.'
	sql_code_ws.c:20073:1: warning: unknown escape sequence '\w'
	sql_code_ws.c:20073:1: warning: unknown escape sequence '\w'

and i dunno what to do with them.
