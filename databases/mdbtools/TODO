Several issues with the port:

 1. Libraries from "pkg/PFRAG.shared-main" are not treated as libraries
    (suffixes).
 2. SHARED_LIBS need to be bumped; I didn't look into API changes
 3. Port fails to build if previous version of mdbtools is installed.  Some
    automake magic is needed to force automake to place -L../* before
    -L/usr/local/lib.
 4. Something probably depends on this port.  Something should probably depend.
    (editors/calligra?)  Didn't look into that.
 5. Architectures.  Tested only on amd64.  Probably gcc-from-ports dependency
    may be patched away.  Didn't look into that.
 6. Patches from current version of port.  Builds without patches, but some of
    those in databases/mdbtools/snapshot/patches seem cosmetical, so they may
    still be needed.
