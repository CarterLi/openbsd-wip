make configure output

-- Redland with broken NEEDED section detected, disabling
-- Could NOT find Redland  (missing:  _REDLAND_VERSION_OK) 

I have made a dirty patch to disable this test, but it needs to be 
investigated further


-------------------

Many tests require running Soprano instance or try to fetch from external URLs
(which seem to not work anymore either). Some are marked below. Beware, that
mark does not mean that it's the only reason of test fail...
