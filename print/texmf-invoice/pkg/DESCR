The invoice package was conceived in late 2000 when the author had
to dig through a truly aweful pile of expense bills without having
a spreadsheet featuring LTEX 2 -compliant output (or any spreadsheet,
for that purpose) available. After several miscalculations with a
pocket calculator due to forgotten or double entries the idea came
up to have LTEX 2 do the calculation work. As such, the package in
its present stage is highly specialized with regard to the documents
it generates.  The invoice package is basically a tailor-made
solution for a consultant who charges fees and claims all sorts of
expenses, sometimes working on different assignments for the same
client.

The author expresses his gratitude to Robert Inder, Thilo Barth,
Jacco Kok, Fred Donck, Jacopo, Johann Spies, Ian Wormsbecker, Vincent
Tougait and Robin Fairbairns who contributed ideas, corrections,
bugfixes and caption translations after the first discussions on
comp.text.tex and the initial release of invoice.

Given the current capabilities of invoice, it should well be possible
to extend the capabilities of this package in the future or to
rewrite it in a generalized fashion.
