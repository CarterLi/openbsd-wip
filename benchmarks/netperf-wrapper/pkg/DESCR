Python wrapper to run multiple simultaneous netperf/iperf/ping instances
and aggregate the results.

Several commands can be run in parallel and, provided they output
timestamped values, the test data points can be aligned with each other
in time, interpolating differences between the actual measurement points.
This makes it possible to graph (e.g.) ping times before, during and
after a link is loaded.

Aggregated data can be saved in a json format, output as csv values,
emacs org mode tables or, if py-matplotlib is installed, plots.
Each test can specify several different plots, including time-series
plots of the values against each other, as well as CDF plots of
(e.g.) ping times.
