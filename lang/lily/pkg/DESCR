Lily is a programming language focused on expressiveness and type
safety.

Features:

* Templating

By default, Lily runs in standalone mode where all content is code to
execute. But Lily can also be run in template mode. In template mode,
code is between <?lily ... ?> tags. When a file is imported, it's always
loaded in standalone mode, so that it doesn't accidentally send headers.
Files that are imported are also namespaced (no 'global namespace').

* Embeddable

Lily may be a statically-typed language, but the reference
implementation is an interpreter. The interpreter as well as its API
have been carefully designed with sandboxing in mind. As a result, it's
possible to have multiple interpreters exist alongside each other.
