Fortran Package Manager (fpm) is a package manager and build system for
Fortran. Its key goal is to improve the user experience of Fortran
programmers. It does so by making it easier to build your Fortran
program or library, run the executables, tests, and examples, and
distribute it as a dependency to other Fortran projects. Fpm's user
interface is modeled after Rust's Cargo, so if you're familiar with that
tool, you will feel at home with fpm. Fpm's long term vision is to
nurture and grow the ecosystem of modern Fortran applications and
libraries.
