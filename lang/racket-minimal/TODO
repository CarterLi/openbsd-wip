- Change from builtpkg to minimal. Upstream is splitting the packages in
individual git repos and I can't follow every change easily (as I did
previously).

- Add instructions to README about how to install packages and add
.racket/version/bin to the PATH. Use drracket as an example.

- Add "gui-pkg-manager" to README.

- Change the name to racket-minimal. Add the entry to devel/quirks.

- "Why there is not a full version of racket?".

- raco pkg install --jobs 2 --auto --binary-lib drracket

- raco pkg install --jobs 2 --auto --binary main-distribution

- Racket is transitioning to a small core + packages model. The traditional "big
package" is now just an distribution. In fact, you can create your own
distribution mixing private and public packages.
