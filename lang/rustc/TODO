Packaging
---------
- bootstrap: need to have a really static bootstrapper
- check if -Wl,--as-needed is ok (has been removed at initial bootstrapping from linux)
	https://github.com/semarie/rust/commit/03cf086c07824e2cb1244dda98ef64cb8de983af

- install
  - move lib to lib/rustc ?
  - keep extrafilename ? (libs are like lib/libarena-4e7c5e5c.so)
  - rustdoc need to known sysroot, but don't have any option to pass it
      if you want use it, you should pass the complete path
      (invoke it like: $ /usr/local/bin/rustdoc bla-bla)
  - rust-gdb is a shell script that require a more recent gdb than base

- clean ${BUILDDIR}/config.mk for not needed program ? (git, curl, ...)

- see any others TODO in Makefile


Bugs
----
- provide a complete load_self function (src/libstd/sys/unix/os.rs)
  - need for backtrace support (read the symbols from executable file)
  - need for rustc --sysroot default value (infer rustlib from rustc location)


Tests failures
--------------
  * [run-pass] run-pass/out-of-stack.rs
      the page guard for stack-overflow detection don't work very well...

  * [run-pass] run-pass/tcp-stress.rs
      intermittent failure
      "Too many open files"
      => may be be a problem in compiletest, as the test is ok when run manually.

  * seems to be unrelated bugs (not trigged without jemalloc)
    [run-pass] run-pass/coerce-match-calls.rs
    [run-pass] run-pass/coerce-match.rs
