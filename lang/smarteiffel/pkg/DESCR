"Eiffel is a pure object-oriented language aimed at the writing of
software components that are easy to read, maintain, test, extend and
reuse. Its emphasis on the collaborative aspects of software
development, as communication and documentation, makes Eiffel a well
suited language to large and very large projects. At the same time, its
simplicity and careful choice of features make it ideal for learning
object-orientation concepts and developing analysis and design skills.

SmartEiffel extends traditional Eiffel care about reliability and good
software engineering practises with a specific concern about runtime
performance and tiny memory footprint."
