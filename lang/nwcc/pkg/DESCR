nwcc is a simple C compiler for Unix systems targeting a variety of
architectures.

Apart from full C89 support, nwcc also provides many C99 and GNU C
features, and can be used as a drop-in replacement for gcc in many
cases.

nwcc has been known to compile many small and medium sized open-source
applications correctly - such as bash, xterm, vim, wget, gxemul, lynx,
lsof, strace, zsh, GNU less/tar/make and others.

Development priorities have traditionally favored language feature
support, portability and compatibility. As a result, nwcc is completely
lacking in optimization and support for debugging or profiling.
