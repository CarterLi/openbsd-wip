dmd
===
dmd is the Digital Mars D compiler.

Caveats
-------
Threading appears to cause segfaults. Single-threaded programs should
be fine.

All D code using the better C subset (code that compiles with the
-betterC flag) should work fine.

Since this is not in the ports tree, report all issues directly to me
(bcallah@).
