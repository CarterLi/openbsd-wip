It needs tests on i386.

I need reorganize the makefile.

Search missing symbols in the binaries, e.g. from plt-games:
/usr/local/bin/gracket:/usr/X11R6/lib/libGLU.so.7.0: undefined symbol

Jewel, Checkers and Gobblet (plt-games) doesn't work. Probably is a bug in both
programs, not in the port. I need test it again.

Describe the 'noopt' flavor in DESCR.
