It needs tests on i386.

I need add a message about the incompatibility of the OpenGL part of racket
with OpenBSD.

Fix LIB/BUILD/RUN_DEPENDS.

Crash on i386. The culprit is probably some change in ports in the last weeks.

The culprit is the update of cairo 1.12.2 -> 1.12.8

Add a note about the bug in Spatial_Transformations.html and images generated
with the doc.

Generate the images on amd64 and install manually on i386 if the filename is
the same. Review
http://docs.racket-lang.org/images/Spatial_Transformations.html and the
filenames of the images.

Other solution is remove the files from both arch and add a note about the
missing files.

The bug will be fixed in the next version of racket.

Review what files are generated by the installer and what not. The
documentation and images are generated, so I can't just copy the files from the
an arch to other.

Add note relate to scheme-script and r6rs (copy the python and ruby notes). Add
link to this section of the standard.
