- Change from builtpkg to core. Upstream is splitting the packages in
individual git repos and I can't follow every change easily (as I did
previously).

- Add instructions to README about how to install packages and add
.racket/version/bin to the PATH. Use drracket as an example.

- Add "gui-pkg-manager" to README.

- Remove unused depends.
