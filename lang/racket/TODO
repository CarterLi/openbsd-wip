It needs tests on i386.

I need reorganize the makefile.

I need add a message about the incompatibility of the OpenGL part of racket
with OpenBSD.

Fix LIB/BUILD/RUN_DEPENDS.

Tests if the binaries and libs are stripped or not.

----

Add a note about the bug in Spatial_Transformations.html and images generated
with the doc.

Generate the images on amd64 and install manually on i386 if the filename is
the same. Review
http://docs.racket-lang.org/images/Spatial_Transformations.html and the
filenames of the images.

Other solution is remove the files from both arch and add a note about the
missing files.

The bug will be fixed in the next version of racket.

Review what files are generated by the installer and what not. The
documentation and images are generated, so I can't just copy the files from the
an arch to other.
