Zig is an open-source programming language designed for robustness,
optimality, and clarity. Zig is a new programming language that is
designed to replace C.

* Robust - behavior is correct even for edge cases such as out of
  memory.

* Optimal - write programs the best way they can behave and perform.

* Clear - precisely communicate your intent to the compiler and other
  programmers. The language imposes a low overhead to reading code.

Zig can be used to integrate closely with existing C code, or
independently, without libc.
