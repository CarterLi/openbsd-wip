Tiny C Compiler
===============
Some caveats when running tcc:
* Linking is done with cc(1) rather than the built-in linker.
  This has some issues:
    1. Running `tcc file.c` will compile and link with cc(1)
    2. `tcc -run` doesn't work (neither does #!/usr/local/bin/tcc -run)
  So follow the two step process of:
    $ tcc -c file.c
      ...
    $ cc -o file file.o ...
