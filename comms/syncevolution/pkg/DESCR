SyncEvolution synchronizes personal information management (PIM) 
data such as contacts, appointments, tasks and memos using the 
Synthesis sync engine, which provides support for the SyncML 
synchronization protocol. SyncEvolution synchronizes with 
SyncML servers over HTTP and with SyncML capable phones locally 
over Bluetooth (new in 1.0). Plugins provide access to the data 
which is to be synchronized.
