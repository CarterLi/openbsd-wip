"barry" is NOT a production sync tool for Blackberry, yet.

"Barry" is primarily intended to be a library, though there is also a 
GUI which lets you do backups (not yet built by this port) and an 
"opensync" plugin (ditto).

People are doing the reverse engineering using this tool
and some windows USB gunk.

The "barry" project team wants help, and having this in ports
will make it easier for people to help.
