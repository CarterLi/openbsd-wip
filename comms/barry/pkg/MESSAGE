To check that the program is working, take a *BACKED UP* blackberry, 
and try this:

- boot -c, disable uberry*
- when it boots up, make sure your device appears as ugen, then do:
     btool -l # dash-ell for list, make sure it sees dev
     btool -v -t

If you get errors about "Bad Packet Size", please note that this
version does not support device passwords yet. Disable your device
password (in the Configuration Tool -> Security Settings) while
working with "barry".  If security matters, then (a) remember to
re-enable the password, and (b) try helping the Barry project to
support device passwords.
