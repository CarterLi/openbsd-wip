"barry" is NOT a production sync tool for Blackberry, yet.
However, barrybackup - the main program of this port - does allow
backup and restore of individual databases on your device.
(Backup is copying your entire Address Book, Synch will be merging
changes from your desktop PIM program and from your device. Someday).
