The program "barrybackup" backs up and restores device databases.

BE SURE you have disabled "uberry" in your kernel.
If "btool -l" finds your BlackBerry, barrybackup should be able
to back it up (though just now there's a "hang" issue that is being
investigated).

Backups are saved in ~/.barry/backup/PIN/PIN-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.tar.gz
