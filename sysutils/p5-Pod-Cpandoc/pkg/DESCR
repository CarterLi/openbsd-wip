"cpandoc" is a perl script that acts like "perldoc" except that if
it would have bailed out with "No documentation found for
"Uninstalled::Module"", it will instead scrape a CPAN index for the
module's documentation.

One important feature of "cpandoc" is that it *only* scrapes the
live index if you do not have the module installed. So if you use
"cpandoc" on a module you already have installed, then it will just
read the already-installed documentation. This means that the version
of the documentation matches up with the version of the code you
have. As a fringe benefit, "cpandoc" will be fast for modules you've
installed. :)

All this means that you should be able to drop in "cpandoc" in place
of "perldoc" and have everything keep working. See "SNEAKY INSTALL"
for how to do this.

If you set the environment variable "CPANDOC_FETCH" to a true value,
then we will print a message to STDERR telling you that "cpandoc"
is going to make a request against the live CPAN index.
