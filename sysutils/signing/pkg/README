+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Validating DISTFILE signatures on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is  a repository of public keys used to validate upstream dist files.

Using ${FULLPKGNAME}
===================

Currently you will need to add the following to your mk.conf file:

  .include "${PREFIX}/share/signing/signing.mk"

SIG_SUFX should be set per port. The most common extension is .asc, but
.sig is a close second.  Currently only validating detatched signatures
is supported.
