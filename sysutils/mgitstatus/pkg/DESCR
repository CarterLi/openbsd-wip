mgitstatus is a tool that loop over multiple Git repositories reporting,
for each one, the uncommitted, untracked and unpushed changes. The
output is nicely formatted using colors to quickly detect which
repositories need action.

When working over several project, mgitstatus is quite helpful to track
unfinished work, not in sync with your remotes. Optionally, it can also
check if the repository needs a pull by fetching remote branches.
