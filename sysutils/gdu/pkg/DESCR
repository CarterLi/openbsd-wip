Pretty fast disk usage analyzer written in Go.

Gdu is intended primarily for SSD disks where it can fully utilize parallel
processing. However HDDs work as well, but the performance gain is not so huge.

gdu binary and manpage are renamed to ggdu to avoid conflict with gdu from GNU
coreutils package.
