Ready for import

Changes since 2.2:

* Only emulate fmemopen(3) on MacOS since it's available everywhere else
* Move platform-specific includes to compat.h
* Replace the now deprecated usleep(3) with nanosleep(2)
* Reduce number of attempts to re-open files to 1 second (10 attempts)
* Unit tests use mock kqueue() instead of triggering events through the
  filesystem
* Print out detailed instructions if the user provides configure arguments
* Fixed a flaw in kqueue emulation that caused a segfault if multiple files were
  saved simultaneously
* Change process title for blocking events (visible in ps(1))
* Wait for processes to terminate in restart mode
* LICENCE file describes the copyright holders for the compatibility libraries
* Reintroduce ${DESTDIR} for STAGEDIR installation
* Prevent interactive utilities from paging output by setting PAGER to /bin/cat 
* Correct the timeout on Linux while consolidating inotify events
* First match of `/_` provides a shortcut for specifying the first file under
  watch
* Build supports Debian with FreeBSD kernel
* Renamed Makefile.linux-lbsd to Makefile.debian
* New `-c` option invokes `clear` before running the utility
* `gcc-lint` make target removed; clang's `scan-build` is much better
* Support Vim's `backup` option by responding to `NOTE_RENAME`
