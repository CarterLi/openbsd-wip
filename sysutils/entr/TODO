Noteworthy changes since 1.9:

* Wait for processes to terminate in restart mode
* LICENCE file describes the copyright holders for the compatibility libraries
* Reintroduce ${DESTDIR} for STAGEDIR installation
* Prevent interactive utilities from paging output by setting PAGER to
  `/bin/cat`
* First match of `/_` provides a shortcut for specifying the file that changed
* New `-c` option invokes `clear` before running the utility
* Support Vim's `backup` option by responding to `NOTE_RENAME`
* Iteratively check for new file system events using a 1ms timeout after a file
  has been renamed or removed in order to prevent the utility from being
  executed before successive changes from a version control system have
  completed.
