Ready for import

* Wait for processes to terminate in restart mode
* Prevent interactive utilities from paging output by setting PAGER to
  `/bin/cat`
* First match of `/_` provides a shortcut for specifying the first file
  that changed
* New `-c` option invokes `clear` before running the utility
* Support Vim's `backup` option by responding to `NOTE_RENAME`
* Iteratively check for new file system events using a 1ms timeout after
  a file has been renamed or removed in order to prevent the utility
  from being executed before successive changes from a version control
  system have completed
