This is an updated version of the Binwalk firmware analysis tool. It has been
re-written in Rust, and is currently considered unstable/experimental.

While the usage and output is similar to that of previous Binwalk releases, this
version has several notable improvements:

- JSON output summary
- Multi-threaded analysis
- Efficient pattern matching
- Smarter file carving and extraction
- Much improved signature validation and reporting
