| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although dinit can be used to boot a Linux system from scratch, you cannot use
dinit as a replacement for OpenBSD's init system. This package does however
allow you to use dinit as a generic process supervisor on OpenBSD.

Running dinit as a Normal User
==============================

To run dinit as a normal user, run:

 $ dinit -u -d /path/to/your/service/descriptions

Process Group Issue
===================

By default dinit tries to kill services by sending the process group a signal.
However, on OpenBSD dinit will fail to obtain the process group ID as
getpgid(2) fails with EPERM. It works on Linux, because there getpgid(2) has
different semantics.

As a workaround, in your service descriptions you need to set:

    options = signal-process-only

As the name suggests, this causes dinit to signal only the PID of the service
and not the whole process group.
