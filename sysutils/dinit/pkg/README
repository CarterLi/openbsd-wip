| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although dinit can be used to boot a Linux system from scratch, you cannot use
dinit as a replacement for OpenBSD's init system. This package does however
allow you to use dinit as a generic process supervisor on OpenBSD.

Running dinit as a Normal User
==============================

To run dinit as a normal user, run:

 $ dinit -d /path/to/your/service/descriptions

Note that -u is implied when running as a non-root user.

Signalling Process Groups
=========================

By default dinit tries to kill services by sending the process group a signal.
However, on OpenBSD dinit will fail to obtain the process group ID as
getpgid(2) fails with EPERM (It works on Linux, because there getpgid(2) has
different semantics).

dinit is smart enough to realise that it should then try signalling the
individual process instead of the process group, but it will emit warnings
like:

dinit: mail-loop: can't signal process group: Operation not permitted
dinit: mail-loop: will signal process only (consider using option = signal-process-only)

IF that bothers you, do as the message says, and put in your service
descriptions:

    options = signal-process-only
