Google Gadgets for Linux provides a platform for running desktop
gadgets under Linux (and other *nix), catering to the unique needs
of Linux users. It's compatible with the gadgets written for Google
Desktop for Windows as well as the Universal Gadgets on iGoogle.

There's two main components to the application: one is a common
gadget library responsible for running and presenting a gadget, and
the other is a host program that allows the user to choose gadgets
and run them on the desktop. Currently we have hosts written for
GTK+ and QT, with the GTK+ host offering a sidebar similar to that
of Google Desktop for Windows.

This package contains GTK+ interface for Google gadgets.
