Qwerty-fr layout has been designed for french people using qwerty
keyboard but who are tired of using us_intl and all its dead keys.
This keyboard layout is fully compliant with traditional qwerty, no standard
keys are replaced with dead keys.  However the AltGr key allow direct
access to all french characters (eg: AltGr + e = e with grave accent).
