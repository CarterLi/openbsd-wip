This project provides AngularJS services for implementing the `Client-Server API`_
on Matrix_ : an open standard for interoperable Instant Messaging and VoIP. It 
comes shipped with Synapse_ : a home server reference implementation.

This project also provides a complete, stand-alone client which can communicate 
with Matrix home servers using a web browser.

The Synapse_ homeserver ships the latest stable version of this library.  If you
wish it to serve up a development copy instead, then you must configure this
checkout to be picked up by synapse::
