HTML::TreeBuilder::XPath is libxml based compatible interface to
HTML::TreeBuilder, which could be slow for a large document.

HTML::TreeBuilder::LibXML is drop-in-replacement for
HTML::TreeBuilder::XPath.

This module doesn't implement all of HTML::TreeBuilder and HTML::Element
APIs, but enough methods are defined so modules like Web::Scraper work.
