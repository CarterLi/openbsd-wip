The uWSGI project aims at developing a full stack for building hosting
services. Application servers (for various programming languages and
protocols), proxies, process managers and monitors are all implemented
using a common api and a common configuration style. It has a pluggable
architecture and can support a range of platforms and languages.

The "WSGI" part in the name is a tribute to the namesake Python
standard, as it has been the first developed plugin for the project.

Versatility, performance, low-resource usage and reliability are the
strengths of the project (and the only rules followed).

This package contains the core uWSGI program, upstream's standard
set of embedded plugins, and a couple of additional plugins with light
dependencies. Other plugins are packaged separately, e.g.
uwsgi-plugin-python2.7 and uwsgi-plugin-lua.
