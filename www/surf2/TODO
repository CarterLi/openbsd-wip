This port is held here mostly for testing/tracking purposes.  Although already
usable, GTK+3 branch of surf is not released yet.  It is likely that in future
it will be merged into mainline surf, but in the mean time it might be a good
idea to keep surf2 as a separate port here.

Note, this port of surf has two customizations that are not present upstream:

 * xterm is used instead of st and
 * DOWNLOAD macros was reworked to make download window display fetched URL and
   then stay until dismissed.
