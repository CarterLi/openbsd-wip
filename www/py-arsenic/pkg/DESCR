Arsenic is a library that allows you to control a web browser from async
Python code. Use cases include testing of web applications, load
testing, automating websites, web scraping or anything else you need a
web browser for. It uses real web browsers using the Webdriver
specification.

While it is built on top of aiohttp, it can be used from any
asyncio-compatible framework, such as Tornado.
