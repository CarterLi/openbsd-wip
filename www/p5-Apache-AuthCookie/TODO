mod_perl 1
mod_perl 2
Both mod_perls at once

I decided to make 2 FLAVORS.
p5-Apache-AuthCookie and -ap2-mod_perl
The same Modules are installed for both, either way.
Each FLAVOR requires different run/build DEPENDS.
-ap2-mod_perl requires TEST_FLAGS
I patched the Makefile.PL to force mod_perl 1 or 2 after meeting run and build depends.
This allows mod_perl 2 testing to actually happen instead of using mod_perl 1 when both mod_perls are installed.
I patched startup.pl to match libraries needed for both flavors (just one patch).
Is all of this OK?
