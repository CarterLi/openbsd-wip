I have fixed problem with make regress by building as non-root user and running make regress.
I need to decide how to deal with building and regressing for 3 possibilities:
mod_perl 1
mod_perl 2
Both mod_perls at once

Modules are installed for both, either way.
Regress tests are different.
Port FLAVORS?
Regress options?
