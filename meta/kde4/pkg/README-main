| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The KDE4 desktop is composed of 2 meta-packages:
    * kde, for a base KDE4 installation
    * kde-extras, for a full KDE4 installation
They are focused on standard usage (i.e. development, and office type
packages are left out on purpose).

Starting KDE4 [REVIEW]
==============
Before running startkde(1), a system-wide D-Bus daemon needs to be
running ("dbus_daemon" needs to be added to the "pkg_scripts" variable
in rc.conf.local(8)).

Then the following line needs to be added:
    exec ${LOCALBASE}/bin/ck-launch-session ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/startkde
in ~/.xinitrc when using startx(1) (console login)
in ~/.xsession when using xdm(1) (X Display Manager login)

mDNS/DNS-SD support [REWRITE]
===================
The avahi-daemon(8) daemon provides Zeroconf support (aka. Bonjour /
Rendezvous) in GNOME. Several applications can optionally benefit from
it (e.g. the "Network" shortcut in nautilus(1)) while some others
will not work at all without it (e.g. seahorse-sharing(1)).

To make use of it, rc.conf.local(5) needs to contain the following line:
    multicast_host=YES
and "avahi_daemon" needs to be added to the "pkg_scripts" variable
_after_ "dbus_daemon".
