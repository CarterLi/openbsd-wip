Lunamark is a lua library and command-line program for conversion of markdown
to other textual formats. Currently HTML, dzslides, Docbook, ConTeXt, LaTeX,
and Groff man are the supported output formats, but it is easy to add new
writers or modify existing ones. The markdown parser is written using a PEG
grammar and can also be modified by the user.
