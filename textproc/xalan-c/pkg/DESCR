Xalan is an XSLT processor for transforming XML documents into 
HTML, text, or other XML document types.

Xalan-C++ version 1.10 is a robust implementation of the W3C 
Recommendations for XSL Transformations (XSLT) and the XML Path 
Language (XPath). It works with a compatible release of the 
Xerces-C++ XML parser: Xerces-C++ version 2.7.0. The focus for 
this release is on bug fixes, pluggable memory management, and 
enhanced stability improvements in stylesheet execution.
