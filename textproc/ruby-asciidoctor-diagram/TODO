The port is working fine and enables a number of tools to be used to
render diagrams. I (sdk@) am using ditaa and plantuml and can confirm
those working. But here's a table with optional dependencies for more
diagram types: https://docs.asciidoctor.org/diagram-extension/latest/

We could add a README describing which diagram types can be made to work
on OpenBSD and which ports/packages need to be installed.

However, this table would need maintenance...
