Miller operates on key-value-pair data while the familiar Unix tools operate
on integer-indexed fields: if the natural data structure for the latter is the
array, then Miller's natural data structure is the insertion-ordered hash map.
This encompasses a variety of data formats, including but not limited to the
familiar CSV, TSV, and JSON. Miller can handle positionally-indexed data as
a special case.
