textproc/liblrdf's forked project from github was used, hence the
weird distribution URL, just testing to see if the whole shebang
works. i tested multimedia/gstreamer-0.10/plugins-bad, audio/hydrogen,
and audio/aqualung.  all compiled fine

NOT ready for import until textproc/liblrdf has been bumped from
0.40 to 0.50 officially, or one of the OpenBSD committers okay this.

textproc/liblrdf is dead so taybin has taken maintainer and his
forked project is at https://github.com/swh/LRDF/
