Create a new feed database to send updates 
to your email address:

$ r2e new you@yourdomain.com

This command will create a configuration file 
and a feed database.

Subscribe to some feeds:

$ r2e add rss2email http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=rss

That's the feed to be notified about OpenBSD news. 
Repeat this for each feed you want to subscribe to.

When you run rss2email, it emails you about every story 
it hasn't seen before. 

r2e run --no-send

Then later, you can ask it to email you new stories:

r2e run
