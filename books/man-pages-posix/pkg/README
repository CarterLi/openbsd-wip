| Using ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Because this package contains pages clashing with the ones provided by OpenBSD,
it's not put into common search directories for man(1). Instead, you're promised
to add something like this to your shell startup file:

  alias pman='man -M ${DOCDIR}/man'
  alias papropos='apropos -M ${DOCDIR}/man'
  alias pwhatis='whatis -M ${DOCDIR}/man'

Then you can call it like usual "man" command:

  papropos pthread
  pman 3 chmod
  pwhatis ldds

Note: OpenBSD does not have category starting with "0", so headers were put into
the "3" category instead.
