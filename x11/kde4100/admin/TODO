From configure:
-- rpm and deb file plugins necessary in system != UNIX ?
-- PORT kfile plugins!!!

ksystemlog: possibly adapt "kernel" mode to OpenBSD? Too much work for now...

Contains a lot of patches for ksystemlog to make it contain useful
defaults; probably they should be wrapped in "#ifdef (__OpenBSD__)".
