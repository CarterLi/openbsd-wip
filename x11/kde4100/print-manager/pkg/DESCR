This project aims to be a full replacement for the current printing
management of KDE:

  * printd: contains a kded module that checks for user print jobs
    and shows a systray icon;
  * printqueue: contains an application that show the printers queue;
  * printer-manager-kcm: configure printers in a very simple way;
  * add-printer: a wizard to add new printers;
  * plasmoid: show printers and it's jobs.
