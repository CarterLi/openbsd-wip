Hello ports-hackers,

I need help with this port. It builds find and x2goclient starts well
but it breaks on SSH connection with x2goserver (gdb output):


Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
[Switching to process 27362, thread 0x203c5a000]

    at sshmasterconnection.cpp:590
590             inet_aton ( reverseTunnelLocalHost.toAscii(), &address.sin_addr );


GDB bt:

It's crashing in channelLoop() -> sshmasterconnection.cpp

Maybe anybody could check it! x2goclient is for me really important!
