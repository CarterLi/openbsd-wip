Care must be taken for the audio output. You can either:
- install an sdl with arts support and use an mplayer with sdl audio output,
- use an mplayer with direct arts support,
- disable arts audio output in kde entirely 
(control panel, multimedia, sound io, no output)

The last option is possibly preferable, as kde arts does not yield real time
performance.
