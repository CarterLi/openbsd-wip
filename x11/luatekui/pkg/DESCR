 TekUI is a small, freestanding and portable graphical user interface (GUI) 
toolkit written in Lua and C. It was initially developed for the X Window 
System and has been ported to Linux framebuffer, raw framebuffer, DirectFB, 
Windows, and other displays since. A VNC server option is available that allows 
the remote control of tekUI applications.

Its main focus is the rapid development of custom-made applications with a 
custom appearance, such as for embedded devices with a display controller (see 
also fitness for the use in embedded systems). In the long term, it is intended 
to feature a class library supporting regular, general-purpose desktop and 
mobile applications.

Being mostly written in the Lua scripting language and using a simple 
inheritance scheme and class library, tekUI is easily extensible with new user 
interface elements. New controls can be written (or prototyped) in Lua and 
ported to C later. The creation of new styles and themes and fitting the 
software to a new device are equally simple.
