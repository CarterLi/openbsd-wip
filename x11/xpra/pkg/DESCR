Xpra is an open-source multi-platform persistent remote display
server and client for forwarding applications and desktop screens.
It gives you remote access to individual applications or full
desktops. It can also be used to forward full desktops, from X11
servers, MS Windows, or Mac OS X. Xpra also allows forwarding of
sound, clipboard and printing services. Sessions can be accessed
over SSH, or password protected over plain TCP sockets with or
without SSL. Xpra is usable over reasonably slow links and does its
best to adapt to changing network bandwidth constraints.
