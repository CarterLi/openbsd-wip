KPersonalTrainer was developed to keep track of data collected by a
heart rate monitor like the Polar Watches, or just any other watch.
When you have added an exercise information is saved in a file and
presented in a table. A calender is shown to give you an overview of the
finished exercises.
KPersonalTrainer also has an option, Weekly Reports, where you can keep
track of your progress.
