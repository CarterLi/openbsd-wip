- some basic functionality works, but a lot still needs to be ported
  to OpenBSD, at least there is some FreeBSD to work with already:
  - print_eth_info.c
  - print_wireless_info.c

* cpu usage only deals with first cpu right now, fix this for MP systems

* test all the various modules and see what functionality is missing.
