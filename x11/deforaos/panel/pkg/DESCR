Panel is the DeforaOS panel manager. It is meant to display an arbitrary
number of desktop panels, with support for one per edge of the screen at
the moment. Each panel can then host a number of applets, implemented as
plug-ins to the main program.

A number of additional utilities is also available, allowing tighter
integration of external applications, as well as when responding to
system events (notifications...).
