KMime is a library for handling mail messages and newsgroup articles.

KMime deals solely with the in-memory representation of messages, topics such a
transport or storage of messages are handled by other libraries, for example by
the mailtransport library or by the KIMAP library. Similary, this library does
not deal with displaying messages or advanced composing, for those there are
the messageviewer and the messagecomposer components in the KDEPIM module.

KMime's main function is to parse, modify and assemble messages in-memory. In a
later section, parsing and assembling is actually explained. KMime provides
high-level classes that make these tasks easy.
