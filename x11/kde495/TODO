The main idea is to make this pie-e-e-ece of shit run. Then make
it stable.  Then polish patches. Then mark as done and start hacking
on KDE5. (*)

Also the option of installing (not building, looks like it's not
possible) KDE3/TDE and KDE4 simultaneously should be investigated.
Curent situation is that there are too many conflicts between KDE3,
KDE4 and TDE. Possibly, some stuff could get installed in ".../kde4"
subdirectories or get a suffix appended.

Note: almost no shared library bumps were made. This should be no
problem if you don't have any KDE 4 packages installed.

We should review patches other *BSDs have, and also OpenSUSE ones
(this Linux distro still supports KDE3 and KDE4).

For more information see main Makefile and TODOs and Makefiles in
subdirectories.
