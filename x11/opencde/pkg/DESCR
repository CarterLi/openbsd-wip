OpenCDE is a free implementation of the Open Group's Common Desktop
Environment, often found on commercial UNIX operating systems such as
Solaris, AIX and HP-UX.

The OpenCDE project aims to keep the code clean and simple, thus easy to
compile and port to other systems. The desktop environment will never
become bloated and features that would add too much complexity to the
code design will be left out until such a time when a clean solution can
be implemented.

The project intends to utilize modern technologies and libraries however
will always steer clear from the massive amounts of dependencies that
are required by many similar projects. The number of dependencies which
are not included in a typical base UNIX install, will always remain low.
