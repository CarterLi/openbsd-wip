You should probably use a compositor with ${PKGSTEM}.

"When there is no compositing manager such as Compiz or xcompmgr running,
Gromit-MPX falls back to a legacy drawing mode. This may drastically slow down
your X-Server, especially when you draw very thin lines. It makes heavy use of
the shape extension, which is quite expensive if you paint a complex pattern on
screen. Especially terminal-programs tend to scroll incredibly slow if
something is painted over their window."
