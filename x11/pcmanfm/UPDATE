major update to 0.9.9, complete rewrite over the 0.3 and 0.5 series.

pcmanfm has been split into 
1) menu-cache
2) libfm
3) pcmanfm

BUGS:
1) trash can support is non-functional or incomprehensible.
2) crashes when clicking on non-existing folders like Music, Pictures, 
   Videos.
3) don't click on thumbnails for file associations as support for it
   is poor.
