Fix build that shared library could be resolved without symlink:
make: don't know how to make /usr/local/lib/libpolkit-qt-core-1.so. Stop in /usr/ports/pobj/kdelibs-4.7.0/build-i386.

Update soprano for enabling nepomuk.

Check were katepart has gone.

Prepend "attica->=0.9.0:" to x11/kde4/attica in LIB_DEPENDS.
