The main idea is to make this pie-e-e-ece of shit run. Then make it stable.
Then polish patches. Then mark as done and start hacking on KDE5. (*)

There are some details in per-port TODO files, like what ports need to be
updated first. And makefiles contain little comments too.

Note: almost no shared library bumps were made. This should be no problem
if you don't have any KDE 4 packages installed.

Looks like debug symbols aren't available at all. But should play with
"debug" flavor more.

Remi Pointel (rpointel@) have other KDE 4 update bits, hope his work will be
merged soon.

Not sure what's worse: warnings about incorrect links when packaging, or
extra "mkdir -p" in almost each port.


admin
	Contains a lot of patches for ksystemlog to make it contain useful
	defaults; probably they should be wrapped in "#ifdef (__OpenBSD__)".

attica
libs
qimageblitz
	Untested, but looks like work fine.

baseapps
pimlibs
runtime
workspace
	Fear of Akonadi lives here. Looks like most crashes are related to
	ASS (Akonadi-Soprano-Strigi) framework. knotify crashes almost
	immediately at start too, but notification sound is played.

kate
multimedia
	Works For Me(TM)

kdenetwork
	Almost unasable: Kopete and Krdc doesn't have protocols support,
	no programs see plugins...

l10n
oxygen-icons
	Done. Ready-to-use packages available at http://www.ohvost.ru/dnl/kde/
