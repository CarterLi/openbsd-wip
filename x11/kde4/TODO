The main idea is to make this pie-e-e-ece of shit run. Then make it stable.
Then polish patches. Then mark as done and start hacking on KDE5. (*)

KDE 4 programs fail in a different ways when they're given a KDE 3 profile.
So until we find a better way, move out (rename) your ~/.kde/, or start
all KDE 4 programs with KDEHOME=~/something/else.

There are some details in per-port TODO files, like what ports need to be
updated first. And makefiles contain little comments too.

Note: almost no shared library bumps were made. This should be no problem
if you don't have any KDE 4 packages installed.

Looks like debug symbols aren't available at all. But should play with
"debug" flavor more.

Remi Pointel (rpointel@) have other KDE 4 update bits, hope his work will be
merged soon.

Not sure what's worse: warnings about incorrect links when packaging, or
extra "mkdir -p" in almost each port.

See also main Makefile.

Many programs produce such warnings:
	ark(28160)/KSharedDataCache: Unable to find an appropriate lock to guard the shared cache.  This *should* be essentially impossible. :( 
	ark(28160)/KSharedDataCache: Unable to perform initial setup, this system probably does not really support process-shared pthreads or semaphores, even though it claims otherwise. 
Likely this is connected with problem of "missing plugins everywhere".

	Contains a lot of patches for ksystemlog to make it contain useful
	defaults; probably they should be wrapped in "#ifdef (__OpenBSD__)".

attica
kdenetwork
libs
qimageblitz
	Untested, but looks like work fine.

baseapps
pimlibs
runtime
workspace
	Fear of Akonadi lives here. Looks like most crashes are related to
	ASS (Akonadi-Soprano-Strigi) framework. knotify crashes almost
	immediately at start too, but notification sound is played.

kate
multimedia
utils
	Works For Me(TM)

konsole
	Tab name formatting doesn't work.

l10n
oxygen-icons
	Done. Ready-to-use packages available at http://www.ohvost.ru/dnl/kde/
