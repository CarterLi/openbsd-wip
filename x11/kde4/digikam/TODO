Wants valgrind as optional (build-time?) dependency.

Those are libraries that could be installed separately, but doesn't have ports and are used statically:
--  libpgf library found..................... NO  (optional - internal version used instead)
--  libclapack library found................. NO  (optional - internal version used instead)

MySQL server should be actually RUN_DEPENDS only, but it's a lot simplier to make CMake detect it, than to patch configuration files.

libkgeomap crashes when trying to use Google Maps. And Marble widget isn't usable (looks like, Marble bug).

Crashed once when importing from directory with >7GB of different pictures.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Build fails because camke find /usr/local/lib/libopencv_calib3d.so but we
have /usr/local/lib/libopencv_calib3d.so.1.0.
The same Problem with other opencv libs. Error Message:

make: don't know how to make /usr/local/lib/libopencv_calib3d.so. Stop in /usr/ports/pobj/digikam4-2.6.0/build-amd64.
*** Error code 2
