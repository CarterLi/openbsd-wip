This tree is to be used to maintain and eventually migrate ports into the
official OpenBSD ports tree. This means that ports in this tree are actively
worked on and may not always build.

The goal of this try-out is to get more people actively involved, and better
keep track of (half-)finished ports out there.

Updates are also welcome; just try to keep this tree clean by removing ports
that are updated/imported upstream.

If you're importing an update, please add an UPDATE file in the ports' directory
with a summary of changes/explanation. This will make it easier to keep
updates and new ports apart. When a port is ready to get committed, please add
an entry to /FINISHED in the following format (subject to change):

net/gnaughty:	ready for import, sent to ports@ (jasperla)

Use a TODO file to list what the outstanding issues are before the port can be
listed in FINISHED.

Also, only commit full ports please. Not just a Makefile or just a diff.

Please let me know if you need write access to this repository.
