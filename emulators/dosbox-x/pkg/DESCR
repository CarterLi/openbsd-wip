As a fork of DOSBox, it retains compatibility with the wide base of DOS
games and DOS gaming DOSBox was designed for. DOSBox-X however goes further,
with a focus on accurate emulation of the hardware and many more ways to
tweak and configure the DOS virtual machine! We believe that a better way
to emulate the legacy PC platform is to give the user all the options they
need to emulate everything from original IBM PC hardware with 64KB of RAM
all the way up to late 90's hardware, whatever it takes to get that game
or software package to run.
