Tunguska is a ternary computer emulator. It is loosely based on the excellent
design of the (binary) 6502-processor by MOS Technology, but entirely ternary.
So instead of having two memory cell states (0, 1), it has three (-1, 0, 1).

The machine uses tryte-width (tryte = ternary analog to "byte") 6, with
3^6=729 states per tryte.
