PLEASE NOTE !!!

Some tools from aircrack-ng suite is strongly linux-specific.
Thus, some of them (like aireplay-ng and airodump-ng) cannot 
be compiled under OpenBSD without a lot of heavy modifications. 
So for now, this port installs only the following tools from
aircrack-ng suite:

* aircrack-ng
* airdecap-ng
* ivstools
* kstats

Feel free to port the rest of suite (aireplay-ng and 
airodump-ng is the most noticeable) and provide patches.
