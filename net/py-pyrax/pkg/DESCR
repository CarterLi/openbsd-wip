A library for working with most OpenStack-based cloud deployments,
though it originally targeted the Rackspace public cloud. For example,
the code for cloudfiles contains the ability to publish your content
on Rackspace's CDN network, even though CDN support is not part of
OpenStack Swift. But if you don't use any of the CDN-related code,
your app will work fine on any standard Swift deployment.
