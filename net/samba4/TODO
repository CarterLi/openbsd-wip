Cannot build correctly when Samba 3.x is installed, linking problems.
https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9773

Integration with our BIND is not possible, but should with net/isc-bind.

Does not respect SHARED_LIBS.

Probably could use our com_err, need to investigate configure script more.

Build fails with devel/readline installed.
