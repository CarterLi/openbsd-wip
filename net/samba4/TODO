Cannot build correctly when Samba 3.x is installed, linking problems.

Upstream says it's our problem.

Integration with our BIND is not possible, but should with net/isc-bind.

Does not respect SHARED_LIBS.

Probably could use our com_err, need to investigate configure script more.

Build fails with devel/readline installed.

Compile and install .pyc and .pyo files to prevent pkg_delete errors.
