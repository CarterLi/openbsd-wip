Vidalia lets you start and stop Tor, see how much bandwidth you are
consuming, see how many circuits you currently have active, see
where these circuits are connected on a global map, view messages
from Tor about its progress and current state, and let you configure
your Tor client, bridge, or relay with a simple interface.
