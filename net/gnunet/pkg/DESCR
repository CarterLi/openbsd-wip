GNUnet is a framework for secure peer-to-peer networking. GNUnet's
primary design goals are to protect the privacy of its users and
to guard itself against attacks or abuse. At this point, GNUnet
offers two primary applications on top of the framework:

* The file-sharing service allows anonymous censorship-resistant
file-sharing. Files, searches and search results are encrypted to
make it hard to control, track or censor users. GNUnet's anonymity
protocol (gap) is designed to make it difficult to link users to
their file-sharing activities. Users can also individually trade-off
between performance and anonymity. Despite providing anonymity,
GNUnet's excess-based economy rewards contributing users with better
performance.  

* The VPN service allows offering of hidden services
within GNUnet (using a .gnunet TLD) and can be used to tunnel IPv4
and IPv6 traffic over the P2P network. The VPN can also be used for
IP protocol translation (6-to-4, 4-to-6) and it is possible to
tunnel IP traffic over GNUnet (6-over-4, 4-over-6).
