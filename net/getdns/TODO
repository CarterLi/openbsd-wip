***  !!! IMPORTANT !!!!
***
***  From release 1.2.0, getdns comes with built-in DNSSEC
***  trust anchor management.  External trust anchor management,
***  for example with unbound-anchor, is no longer necessary
***  and no longer recommended.
***
***  Previously installed trust anchors, in the default location -
***
***        /etc/unbound/getdns-root.key
***
***  - will be preferred and used for DNSSEC validation, however
***  getdns will fallback to trust-anchors obtained via built-in
***  trust anchor management when the anchors from the default
***  location fail to validate the root DNSKEY rrset.
***
***  To prevent expired DNSSEC trust anchors to be used for
***  validation, we strongly recommend removing the trust anchors
***  on the default location when there is no active external
***  trust anchor management keeping it up-to-date.
