- Update to 0.4: (done)
- Fix:
    2023-02-11T15:50:33.433155Z ERROR panic: thread 'main' panicked at
        'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Error { kind:
        Uncategorized, message: "no current exe available (short)" }':

        notify-rust-4.5.10/src/notification.rs:23

    notify-rust is now vendored and current_exe is replaced. However
    it looks like the vendored version is not being picked up. When I
    remove the crate from crates.inc, the build fails because it can't
    find notify-rust.

Notes:
    Vendored crates:
        curve25519-dalek
        libsignal-protocol
        libsignal-service
