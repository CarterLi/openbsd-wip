Instant Messenger proxy with monitoring, blocking and content-filtering
capabilities. Currently it supports MSN, Jabber/XMPP, AIM, ICQ, Yahoo,
IRC and Gadu-Gadu to different degrees. MSN is the principle protocol,
as it's the most popular these days, at least in the UK where I'm based.
The supported platforms are at present Linux and BSD when using the pf
firewall, but porting to other UNIXs should be trivial. It is able to
log to plain files, as well as several types of SQL database including
MySQL, SQLite and PostreSQL.
