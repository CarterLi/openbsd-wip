SleekXMPP is an MIT licensed XMPP library for Python 2.6/3.1+, and is
featured in examples in XMPP: The Definitive Guide by Kevin Smith, Remko
Tron√ßon, and Peter Saint-Andre.

SleekXMPP's design goals and philosphy are:

Low number of dependencies

    Installing and using SleekXMPP should be as simple as possible,
    without having to deal with long dependency chains.

    As part of reducing the number of dependencies, some third party
    modules are included with SleekXMPP in the thirdparty directory.
    Imports from this module first try to import an existing installed
    version before loading the packaged version, when possible.
Every XEP as a plugin
    Following Python's "batteries included" approach, the goal is to
    provide support for all currently active XEPs (final and draft).
    Since adding XEP support is done through easy to create plugins, the
    hope is to also provide a solid base for implementing and creating
    experimental XEPs.
Rewarding to work with
    As much as possible, SleekXMPP should allow things to "just work"
    using sensible defaults and appropriate abstractions. XML can be
    ugly to work with, but it doesn't have to be that way.
