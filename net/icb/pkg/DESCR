Icb is a minimalistic FIFO- and filesystem-based Internet Citizen's Band (ICB)
client. It creates an icb directory with subdirectory for ICB server, where
subdirectries for group and nick name directories. In the leaf directories a
FIFO file in and and normal file out are placed. The in file is used to
communicate with the server and the out file contains the chat log. For every
nick name there will be new in and out files. The basic idea of this is to be
able to communicate with an ICB server with basic command line tools.

Icb lacks its own networking support. It relies on UCSPI-compliant network
client instead.
