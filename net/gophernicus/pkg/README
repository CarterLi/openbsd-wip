| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Setting up a gopher site
========================

After installing the gophernicus package, edit /etc/inetd.conf and add
the following, all on one line:

gopher stream tcp nowait _gophernicus ${TRUEPREFIX}/libexec/in.gophernicus	in.gophernicus -ne -nm -nu -h hostname

Replace "hostname" with the system's hostname, this should be valid
and resolvable as it is used to construct links.

inetd(8) must be reloaded (or started). To enable it at boot, the
following line needs to be added to rc.conf.local(8):
inetd_flags=

By default Gophernicus serves documents from /var/gopher and will
only serve files which are world-readable; being readable by the
server process is not enough.

For more information, see ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/doc/gophernicus/README.

pledge(2) / unveil(2)
=====================

The above inetd.conf(8) line starts ${PKGSTEM} in the most secure mode of
operation with regards to pledge(2) and unveil(2). In this configuration, some
features are disabled in favour of tighter security:

 * The `-ne` argument disables executable gophermaps. If this argument is
   removed, unveil(2) is totally disabled, since we cannot know what paths an
   arbitrary popen(3)ed shell command might require. Additionally 'exec' is
   passed to pledge(2).

 * The `-nm` argument disables shared-memory usage. If this argument is
   removed, pledge(2) will be totally disabled, as pledge(2) never allows
   shared memory.

 * The `-nu` argument disables personal gopher spaces. If this argument is
   removed, we unveil(2) /home and /etc/pwd.db, and 'getpw' is passed to
   pledge(2).

If any of these arguments are not present, ${PKGSTEM} will warn via syslog(3).
