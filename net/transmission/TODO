1. break/fix: transmission-gtk segfaults in gdk-pixbuf2 on amd64

   The segfault has been traced to a truncated pointer returning from
   gdk_pixbuf_new_from_inline, a library function of graphics/gdk-pixbuf.
   The call is from gtk/actions.c.  The problem occurs on amd64, but
   not on i386 (of course).

   The top 32-bits of the returned value will be 0x00000000 or 0xffffffff.
   It's fine in the library, and truncated upon return to the application.
   
   This is from debugging with fprintf()s sprinkled through the mentioned
   source module and the gdk-pixbuf library.  gdb/egdb isn't very helpful,
   as the multithreaded operation of the application precludes clean step
   through.  

2. await next upstream release to post to ports@
