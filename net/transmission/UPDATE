Testing net/transmission beyond 4.0.6:

1) git clone -b obsd --recurse-submodules git@github.com:jggimi/transmission.git transmission-4.0.x

   jggimi/transmission is a fork of transmission/transmission. In branch obsd,
   it's submodule third-party/fmt has been reverted to release 10.2.1.  This
   matches bdep devel/fmt. 

2) create tarball, xz compress it, move to distfiles. 

   `sh archive.sh`  will create a git archive tarball with all source submodules,
   compress it, and move it into /usr/ports/distfiles.

3) pkg_delete transmission
4) make clean=all, makesum, (patch, update-patches), update-plist, port-lib-depends-check, install-all
5) make test, there should be zero failures
6) test the application suite
