Preparing for the next release of the app, using an svn trunk
from their development branch.

If testing, manually download the appropriate "nightly tarball"
from the upstream website and store in $DISTDIR.  These tarballs
are stored on a non-$MASTER_SITES server.

Significant changes:

    qt4 -> qt5
    addition of c++11 and gnu++11

All applications appear to be working on amd64.

Note:
	Circumvention in a patch to gtk/Makefile.in for a deprecated 
	gdk_pixbuf function prototype affecting transmission-gtk 
	on 64-bit archs.  Upstream devs reviewing issue.

	http://marc.info/?t=145593948000001&r=1&w=2

	Added autoconf and no-autoheader to $CONFIGURE_STYLE
	in order to have post-patch touches to avoid triggering
	autoconf after patching gtk/Makefile.in.

To-do: await next upstream release, will update and retest 
       once or twice per month to stay up-to-date.
