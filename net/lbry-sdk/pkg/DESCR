LBRY is a decentralized peer-to-peer protocol for publishing and
accessing digital content. It utilizes the LBRY blockchain as a
global namespace and database of digital content. Blockchain entries
contain searchable content metadata, identities, rights and access
rules. LBRY also provides a data network that consists of peers
(seeders) uploading and downloading data from other peers, possibly
in exchange for payments, as well as a distributed hash table used
by peers to discover other peers.

LBRY SDK for Python is currently the most fully featured implementation
of the LBRY Network protocols and includes many useful components
and tools for building decentralized applications.
