The port does not use upstream dependencies' versions (which are too
old for ports),  so special care is required to make sure that things
work.

Currently a lot of tests is broken because of py-elasticsearch seems
to be broken on python 3.9.  (Our port appears to be too outdated.)

This port creates a new user,  so this change to infrastructure is
required for the package to be built:
