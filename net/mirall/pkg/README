Resource limits
===============
If syncing directories with a large amount of files fails with a "Too
many open files" message, raise your resource limits. This can be done
temporarily in your shell (in ksh(1) you might use "ulimit -n 1024").
For a more permanent change, increase the openfiles limits for your
user's class in /etc/login.conf; this takes effect at login.
