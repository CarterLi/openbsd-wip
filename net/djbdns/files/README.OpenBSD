To setup an authoritative server:
  tinydns-conf _tinydns _dnslog /etc/tinydns <IP address>

To log by syslog instead of multilog, edit /etc/tinydns/log/run
and change the line to:
  exec logger -t tinydns -p daemon.info


To start it you should have svscan monitoring a directory;
  mkdir /service
  svscan /service/ &
then symlink it in:
  ln -s /etc/tinydns /service/
