MongooseIM is Erlang Solutions' robust and efficient XMPP server,
aimed at large installations. Specifically designed for enterprise
purposes, it is fault-tolerant, can utilise the resources of multiple
clustered machines, and easily scale when more capacity is required
(by just adding a box/VM). It provides support for WebSockets and
reimplemented BOSH.
