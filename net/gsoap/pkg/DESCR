The gSOAP toolkit is a C and C++ software development toolkit for
SOAP/XML Web services and generic (non-SOAP) C/C++ XML data
bindings. The toolkit analyzes WSDLs and XML schemas (separately or as a
combined set) and maps the XML schema types and the SOAP messaging
protocols to easy-to-use and efficient C and C++ code. It also supports
exposing (legacy) C and C++ applications as SOAP/XML Web services by
auto-generating XML serialization code and WSDL specifications. Or you
can simply use it to automatically convert XML to/from C and C++
data. The toolkit supports options to generate pure ANSI C or C++ with
or without STL.
