- tweak openafs-setup to work in a client-less environment
 - when setting up a secondary server
   - perhaps dig in dns to have a complete list of servers
   - actually ask for existing server(s) instead of just the primary
- merge withcache into main build and use a subpackage
- determine problem with lkm (fails to insert due to missing symbols currently)
- checkout pthreaded servers, if better than lwp install by default
- remove /usr/afs/etc (last transarc path)
- consider a transarc path flavor, UofA and likely other places may wish
  to have uniform paths across all servers
