- tweak openafs-setup
 - when setting up a secondary server
   - perhaps dig in dns to have a complete list of servers
   - actually ask for existing server(s) instead of just the primary
   - figure out how to bootstrap a cell without an afs client (if it is
     possible), alternately get the lkm working
- merge withcache into main build and use a subpackage
- determine problem with lkm (fails to insert due to missing symbols currently)
- checkout pthreaded servers, if better than lwp install by default
- /usr/afs
  - add to fake area so openafs-setup doesn't do it until src mods remove the
    path from being necessary
- consider a transarc path flavor, UofA and likely other places may wish
  to have uniform paths across all servers
- annotate sample krb5.conf with optional dns entries that can
  deprecate having manually specified bits in krb5.conf
