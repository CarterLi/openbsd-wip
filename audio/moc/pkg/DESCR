MOC (music on console) is a console audio player for LINUX/UNIX
designed to be powerful and easy to use.

MOC plays smoothly, regardless of system or I/O load because it
uses the output buffer in a separate thread. It provides gapelss
playback because the next file to be played is precached while the
current file is playing.

Internet streams (Icecast, Shoutcast) are supported. Key mapping
can be fully customized.

Supported file formats include: MP3, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, Musepack,
Speex, WAVE (and other less popular formats supported by Sndfile),
MOD, WavPack, AAC, SID, MIDI. Moreover most audio formats recognized
by FFMpeg/LibAV are also supported (e.g. MP4, Opus, WMA, APE, AC3,
DTS - even embedded in video files).

Other features:
  * Mixer (both software and hardware) and simple equalizer
  * Color themes
  * Searching playlist or a directory
  * Configurable title creation from filenames and file tags
  * Optional character set conversion for file tags using iconv()
  * OSS, ALSA, JACK and SNDIO output
  * User defined keys
  * Cache for files' tags
