MOC (music on console) is a console audio player for LINUX/UNIX
designed to be powerful and easy to use.

MOC plays smoothly, regardless of system or I/O load because it
uses the output buffer in a separate thread. It provides gapelss
playback because the next file to be played is precached while the
current file is playing.

Internet streams (Icecast, Shoutcast) are supported. Key mapping
can be fully customized.

Supported file formats are: MP3, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, Musepack (mpc),
Speex, Opus, WAVE, those supported by FFmpeg/LibAV (e.g., WMA,
RealAudio, AAC, MP4), AIFF, AU, SVX, Sphere Nist WAV, IRCAM SF,
Creative VOC, SID, wavpack, MIDI and modplug.

Other features:

  - Simple mixer
  - Color themes
  - Menu searching (playlist or directory) like M-s in Midnight Commander
  - The way MOC creates titles from tags is configurable
  - Optional character set conversion for file tags using iconv()
  - OSS, ALSA, SNDIO and JACK output
  - User defined keys
  - Cache for files' tags
