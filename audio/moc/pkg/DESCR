MOC (music on console) is a console audio player for LINUX/UNIX designed
to be powerful and easy to use.

You just need to select a file from some directory using the menu similar to
Midnight Commander, and MOC will start playing all files in this directory
beginning from the chosen file.  There is no need to create playlists as in
other players.

If you want to combine some files from one or more directories in one playlist,
you can do this.  The playlist will be remembered between runs or you can save
it as an m3u file to load it whenever you want.

Need the console where MOC is running for more important things?  Need to close
the X terminal emulator?  You don't have to stop playing - just press q and the
interface will be detached leaving the server running.  You can attach it later,
or you can attach one interface in the console, and another in the X terminal
emulator, no need to switch just to play another file.

MOC plays smoothly, regardless of system or I/O load because it uses the
output buffer in a separate thread. It provides gapless playback because
the next file to be played is precached while the current file is
playing.

Supported file formats are: MP3, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, Musepack (mpc),
Speex, Opus, WAVE, those supported by FFmpeg/LibAV (e.g., WMA,
RealAudio, AAC, MP4), AIFF, AU, SVX, Sphere Nist WAV, IRCAM SF, Creative
VOC, SID, wavpack.
