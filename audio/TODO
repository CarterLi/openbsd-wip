I use this port until now. I had been using it for over one month.  It's a great
piece of software. I did not find functional problems but one design error.

Cantata can't find oxygen icons (runtime output):

QPixmap::scaled: Pixmap is a null pixmap
QPixmap::scaled: Pixmap is a null pixmap
QPixmap::scaled: Pixmap is a null pixmap
QPixmap::scaled: Pixmap is a null pixmap
QPixmap::scaled: Pixmap is a null pixmap

for all oxygen icons. NEED HELP ;-)
