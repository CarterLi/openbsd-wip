Speech Dispatcher provides a high-level interface to Text-to-Speech
systems and makes it possible to combine different applications
with different speech synthesizers. Both Free Software and proprietary
synthesizers are supported. Speech Dispatcher also manages
synchronization and serialization of speech messages so that they
are spoken in an orderly manner.
