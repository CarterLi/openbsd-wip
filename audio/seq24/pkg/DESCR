Seq24 was created to provide a very simple interface for editing and
playing midi 'loops'. After searching for a software based sequencer
that would provide the functionality needed for a live performance, such
as the Akai MPC line, the Kawai Q80 sequencer, or the popular Alesis
MMT-8, I found nothing similar in the software realm. I set out to
create a very minimal sequencer that excludes the bloated features of
the large software sequencers, and includes a small subset of features
that I have found usable in performing.
