AdPlay/UNIX is AdPlug's UNIX console-based frontend. AdPlug is a free,
universal OPL2 audio playback library. AdPlay/UNIX supports the full range
of AdPlug's file format playback features. Despite this, at the moment, only
emulated OPL2 output is supported by AdPlay/UNIX, but this on a wide range
of output devices.
