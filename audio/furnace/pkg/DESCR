Furnace is a tool which allows you to create music using sound chips
("chiptune"), most from the 8/16-bit era.

It has a large selection of features and sound chips. From the NES, SNES
and Genesis to ES5506, VIC-20 or even Arcade, Furnace has most likely
covered your target with many presets to choose from.

Every chip is emulated using many emulation cores, therefore the sound
that Furnace produces is authentic to that of real hardware.
