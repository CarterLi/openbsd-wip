Sam is a text editor originally written for the Blit graphical terminal
connected to a machine running 9th Edition Research Unix. It contained many
useful innovations, the most famous of which was its use of structural regular
expressions.

Sam was the standard text editor for Plan 9 from Bell Labs, and the Plan 9
version was backported to Unix and the X Window Sytem in the 1980s.

This version of sam is based on that 1980s Unix port, with many useful additions
and modifications (see New Features).

Note that this is not stable software. This version of sam is under heavy
development; the goal being to get it working before making it beautiful. That
being said, it's my primary editor, so any major bugs tend to get fixed pretty
quickly. Still, be careful with it.
