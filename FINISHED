# Please add one line per port that is ready to go into OpenBSD.
# When a port has been committed upstream, remove it from this repository.

# Format: pkgpath	message (owner)

# For example:
# net/gnaughty:	ready for import, sent to ports@ (jasperla)
x11/roxterm:	update to 2.0.1 done, sent to ports@ (amitkulz)
database/tinycdb:	ready for import, sent to ports@ 2005/8 (chrueger)
textproc/calibre:	update to 0.8.16, sent to ports@ (viq) Needs further work for enhanced functionality, but that's separate from the update.
