# Please add one line per port that is ready to go into OpenBSD.
# When a port has been committed upstream, remove it from this repository.
#
# Format: pkgpath	message (owner)
#
# For example:
# net/gnaughty:	ready for import, sent to ports@ (jasperla)
textproc/calibre:	update to 0.8.16, sent to ports@ (viq) Needs further work for enhanced functionality, but that's separate from the update.
net/climm:		ready for import, has been sent to ports@ some time ago
games/extremetuxracer:	basically ready if no tweaks are needed
multimedia/kguitar:	basically ready if no tweaks are needed
sysutils/conky:		enhanced functionality, sent to ports@ and maintainer
