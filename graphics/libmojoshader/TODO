version is not set ${WRKSRC}/mojoshader_version.h
likely not done by configure stage, see how to best fix this in a smart way

Should be:
#define MOJOSHADER_VERSION 1181
#define MOJOSHADER_CHANGESET "hg-1181:b873f3b0f838"

(This was not an issue when cmake building in a separate directory outside the ports tree.
