The Create Project provides shared resources for use by creative
applications such as Blender, CinePaint, the GIMP, Inkscape, and
Scribus.

The package includes brushes, color swatches files, gradients, etc.
, so that the user doesn't need to install all of these resources
separately for each and every application that can read such data.
