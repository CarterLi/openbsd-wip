Clutter is an open source software library for creating fast,
compelling, portable and dynamic graphical user interfaces.

Clutter uses OpenGL for rendering (and optionally OpenGL|ES for use on
mobile and embedded platforms), but wraps an easy to use, efficient,
flexible API around GL's complexity.
