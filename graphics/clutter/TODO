- At least calling clutter_init() doesn't crash somewhere deep down in
  Mesa anymore. But another issue is left; clutter doesn't redraw the window
  anymore. The window is still responsive, but it's not refreshed...as can be
  seen with libchamplain-demo from openbsd-wip/geo/libchamplain or any of the
  examples built along with clutter...
