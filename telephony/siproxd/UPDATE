NOTE: This update depends on an updated telephony/libosip2.

This diff updates siproxd to 0.8.1. It is based on stephan@'s
earlier diff at
http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-ports&m=127409163726259&w=2 but I have
made these additional changes:

- Ensured that the default plugins distributed with siproxd are
  installed (plugins were introduced in siproxd 0.7.1).

- Made the default siproxd.conf file look for plugins in the correct
  directory.

- If chrooting is used, prevent siproxd from creating a redundant PID
  file outside the chroot jail.

- Added an rc script for siproxd.

- Added USE_LIBTOOL=Yes and libltdl LIB_DEPENDS. Note that for this to
  work I had to tell CONFIGURE_ENV to set a funky -D define in CFLAGS;
  otherwise we will get an "undefined reference to
  `lt__PROGRAM__LTX_preloaded_symbols'" error with libtool/libltdl 2.4.
  I am not sure if this is the right way to do it.
