Sofia-SIP is an open-source SIP User-Agent library, compliant with the IETF
RFC3261 specification. It can be used as a building block for SIP client
software for uses such as VoIP, IM, and many other real-time and
person-to-person communication services. The primary target platform for
Sofia-SIP is GNU/Linux. Sofia-SIP is based on a SIP stack developed at the Nokia
Research Center.

There are also multiple example clients under the "sofia-sip/utils" directory:

- sip-options, query using SIP OPTIONS method
- sip-date, SIP date printer/parser

The Sofia-SIP su submodule also provides some small utilities:

- addrinfo, resolve host names
- localinfo, prints information about local network interfaces
