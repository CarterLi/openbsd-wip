Mediastreamer2 is a powerful and lightweighted streaming engine
specialized for voice/video telephony applications.

It is the library that is responsible for all the receiving and
sending of multimedia streams in linphone, including voice/video
capture, encoding and decoding, and rendering.

Mediastreamer2 features:

  * Capture and playback from various platform dependent sound
    architectures (ALSA, AudioUnits, AudioQueue, WaveApi).
  * Send and receive RTP streams.
  * Encode and decode the following audio formats: speex, G711, GSM,
    iLBC, AMR, AMR-WB, G722, SILK, G729, and video formats H263,
    theora, MPEG4, H264 and VP8.
  * Read and write from/to a wav file.
  * Read YUV pictures from a camera based on platform dependents APIs.
  * Optimized rendering of YUV pictures.
  * Dual tones generation.
  * Custom tone detector.
  * Echo cancelation, based on speex library or webrtc AEC on android.
  * Audio conferencing.
  * Audio parametric equalizer.
  * Volume control, automatic gain control.
  * ICE for optimized NAT traversal.
  * Adaptive bitrate control algorithm: for automatic adaption of
    encoder bitrate based on received RTCP feedback.

Mediastreamer2 can be extended with dynamic plugins, currently H264,
ILBC, SILK, AMR, AMR-WB and G729 codec plugins are available.
